                "description": "The \"COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by Facility\" dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, filtered for Connecticut. View the full dataset and detailed metadata here: https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u\n\nThe following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term “collection_week” signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a “collection_week” of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either “_coverage”, “_sum”, or “_avg”.\n\nA “_coverage” append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.\n\nA “_sum” append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nA “_avg” append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with “-999,999”.\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\nhhs_ids\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n\n\nOn May 8, 2021, this data set has been converted to a corrected data set. The corrections applied to this data set are to smooth out data anomalies caused by keyed in data errors. To help determine which records have had corrections made to it. An additional Boolean field called is_corrected has been added. To see the numbers as reported by the facilities, go to:\nhttps://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/uqq2-txqb\n\nOn May 13, 2021 Changed vaccination fields from sum to max or min fields.

In recent years, Citizen Perception Surveys have been carried out annually to gather data and report on the measures. \n\nTaking into account the recent modifications in performance measures as well as the focus on continuous improvement, the 2014 research was designed to: \n- Measure the progress with respect to the key performance measures\n- Understand the drivers of the performance measures and provide recommendations about how the measures can be further improved.\n- Make comparisons with past measures wherever applicable",

Some systems serve more than one city. The layer lists just the primary city served. Bikeshare includes systems that are open to the general public, IT-automated, and station based (contain hubs to which users can grab and return a bike) as well as dockless systems. The layer includes a count of the number of docking stations, the number of dockless bikeshare systems, and the number of e-scooter systems serving a city (if applicable) in each year. Counts are for 12/31 of the year except 2020 which is as of 08/31/2020.",

The data reflects violations that occurred from July 1, 2014 until present, minus the most recent 14 days. This data may change due to occasional time lags between the capturing of a potential violation and the processing and determination of a violation. The most recent 14 days are not shown due to revised data being submitted to the City of Chicago. The reported violations are those that have been collected by the camera and radar system and reviewed by two separate City contractors. In some instances, due to the inability the registered owner of the offending vehicle, the violation may not be issued as a citation. However, this dataset contains all violations regardless of whether a citation was issued, which provides an accurate view into the Automated Speed Enforcement Program violations taking place in Children's Safety Zones. More information on the Safety Zone Program can be found here: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html.

These data will be updated as new orders are collected. Any orders not available through publicly accessible websites are not included in these data. Only official copies of the documents or, where official copies were unavailable, official press releases from government websites describing requirements were coded, as well as official government communications such as announcements that counties have progressed through new phases of reopening pursuant to an executive order, directive, or other executive branch action, and posted to government websites; news media reports on restrictions were excluded. Recommendations and guidance documents not included or adopted by reference in an order are not included in these data. These data do not include mandatory business closures, curfews, or requirements/recommendations for people to stay in their homes. Due to limitations of the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network Data Explorer, these data do not include tribes or cities, nor was a distinction made between county orders that applied county-wide versus those that were limited to unincorporated areas of the county. Effective and expiration dates were coded using only the date provided; no distinction was made based on the specific time of the day the order became effective or expired. These data do not necessarily represent an official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

                "description": "The King County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) is providing offense report data captured in it's Records Management System (RMS) from 2020 to present. KCSO replaced its RMS in late 2018 and at the same time transitioned to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The NIBRS standardization of crime classifications allows for comparison over time and between agencies. For official KCSO NIBRS reporting, please visit the WASPC Crime in Washington Report: https://www.waspc.org/cjis-statistics---reports.\n\nDisclaimer: Only finalized (supervisor approved) reports are released. Those in draft, awaiting supervisor approval, or completed after the daily update of data, will not appear until the subsequent day(s). Data updates once every twenty-four hours. Records and classification changes will occur as a report makes its way through the approval and investigative process, thus reports might appear in the data set one day, but be removed the next day if there is a change in the approval status. This mirrors the fluidity of an investigation.  Once a report is re-approved, it will show back up in the data set. Other than approval status, the report case status is factored into what can be released in the daily data set. As soon as a report case status matches the criteria for release, it will be included in the data set. For a list of offenses that are included in the data set, please see the attached pdf.\n\nResources:\n - KCSO's 2019 crime data: https://data.kingcounty.gov/Law-Enforcement-Safety/King-County-Sheriff-s-Office-Incident-Dataset/rzfs-wyvy\n- Police District GIS shapefile: https://gis-kingcounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/king-county-sheriff-patrol-districts-patrol-districts-area/explore\n- Police District key: https://data.kingcounty.gov/Law-Enforcement-Safety/KCSO-Patrol-Districts/ptrt-hdax/data\n- For more information on definitions and classifications, please visit https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/nibrs\n- SPD's Crime Data: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5",

                "description": "This dataset contains aggregate COVID-19 case counts and rates by date of first report for all counties in Pennsylvania and for the state as a whole.  Counts include both confirmed and probable cases as defined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE).  At present, a person is counted as a case only once.  Note that case counts by date of report are influenced by a variety of factors, including but not limited to testing availability, test ordering patterns (such as day of week patterns), labs reporting backlogged test results, and mass screenings in nursing homes, workplaces, schools, etc.  Case reports received without a patient address are assigned to the county of the ordering provider or facility based on provider zip code.  Cases reported with a residential address that does not match to a known postal address per the commonwealth geocoding service are assigned to a county based on the zip code of residence.  Many zip codes cross county boundaries so there is some degree of misclassification of county.  All counts may change on a daily basis due to reassignment of jurisdiction, removal of duplicate case reports, correction of errors, and other daily data cleaning activities. Downloaded data represents the best information available as of the previous day. <br>\nData will be updated between 11:30 am to 1:30pm each Wednesday.",

An incident is considered an event that has been reported to the Police; it does not necessarily indicate a crime has occurred. Norfolk Police Department policy requires a Use-of-Force report every time an officer must do more than routine use of handcuffs or hands to hold, guide, or lead a person.  Complaint data for findings that are still pending are excluded from this report. This data will be updated every weekday and encompasses a rolling five years.",

This dataset does not include fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that did not occur at a hospital, nursing home, or adult care facility. The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users with information about healthcare facility fatalities among patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 disease. \r\n\r\nThe information in this dataset is also updated daily on the NYS COVID-19 Tracker at https://www.ny.gov/covid-19tracker.\r\n\r\nThe data source for this dataset is the daily COVID-19 survey through the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). Hospitals, nursing homes, and adult care facilities are required to complete this survey daily. The information from the survey is used for statewide surveillance, planning, resource allocation, and emergency response activities. Hospitals began reporting for the HERDS COVID-19 survey in March 2020, while Nursing Homes and Adult Care Facilities began reporting in April 2020. It is important to note that fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that occurred prior to the first publication dates are also included. \r\n\r\nThe fatality numbers in this dataset are calculated by assigning age groups to each patient based on the patient age, then summing the patient fatalities within each age group, as of each reporting date. The statewide total fatality numbers are calculated by summing the number of fatalities across all age groups, by reporting date. The fatality percentages are calculated by dividing the number of fatalities in each age group by the statewide total number of fatalities, by reporting date. The fatality numbers represent the cumulative number of fatalities that have been reported as of each reporting date.",

This dataset does not include fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that did not occur at a hospital, nursing home, or adult care facility. The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users with information about healthcare facility fatalities among patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 disease. \n\nThe information in this dataset is also updated daily on the NYS COVID-19 Tracker at https://www.ny.gov/covid-19tracker.\n\nThe data source for this dataset is the daily COVID-19 survey through the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). Hospitals, nursing homes, and adult care facilities are required to complete this survey daily. The information from the survey is used for statewide surveillance, planning, resource allocation, and emergency response activities. Hospitals began reporting for the HERDS COVID-19 survey in March 2020, while Nursing Homes and Adult Care Facilities began reporting in April 2020. It is important to note that fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that occurred prior to the first publication dates are also included. \n\nThe fatality numbers in this dataset are calculated by summing the patient fatalities by patient sex, as of each reporting date. The statewide total fatality numbers are calculated by summing the number of fatalities across all patient sexes, by reporting date. The fatality percentages are calculated by dividing the number of fatalities in each patient sex by the statewide total number of fatalities, by reporting date. The fatality numbers represent the cumulative number of fatalities that have been reported as of each reporting date.",

                "description": "This dataset reports on the operation state of traffic signals in Austin, TX. Traffic signals enter flash mode when something is preventing the signal from operating normally. This is typically the result of a power surge, power outage, or damage to signal equipment. A signal may also be intentionally placed into flash mode for maintenance purposes or be scheduled to flash overnight. \n\nYou can view an interactive map of flashing traffic signals here:\nhttp://transportation.austintexas.io/signals-on-flash\n\n\nApproximately 90% of the City’s signals communicate with our Advanced Trasnportation Management System. When these signals go on flash, they will be reported in this dataset. Although we are extending communications to all signals, approximately 10% are not currently captured in this dataset. It also occasionally happens that the event that disables a traffic signal also disables network communication to the signal, in which case the signal outage will not be reported here.\n\nIn this dataset the distinction between scheduled and unscheduled flash is identified by the 'operation state' column. A signal that is in unscheduled flash mode will have a status of 2 or 7. A signal that is in in scheduled flash mode will have a status of 1.\n\nThis product is for informational purposes and may not have been prepared for or be suitable for legal, engineering, or surveying purposes. It does not represent an on-the-ground survey and represents only the approximate relative location of traffic signals.",

This includes emergency medical services (EMS) calls, fires, rescue incidents, and all other services handled by the Fire Department.\nAll runs are coded according to classification: for EMS, this includes ALS (advanced life support); BLS (basic life support); etc.\n\nData Creation: This data is created when a run is entered into the City of Cincinnati’s computer-aided dispatch (CAD) database.\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the City of Cincinnati's computer aided dispatch (CAD) database.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This data is updated daily.\n\nCincyInsights: The City of Cincinnati maintains an interactive dashboard portal, CincyInsights in addition to our Open Data in an effort to increase access and usage of city data. This data set has an associated dashboard available here: https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/6jrc-cmn5\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics  facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati’s Open Data Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets: (1) the last two digits of all addresses have been replaced with “XX,” and in cases where there is a single digit street address, the entire address number is replaced with \"X\"; and (2) Latitude and Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area (but not the exact location) of the incident.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Salary steps are a proxy for teaching experience, as teachers move one step up the salary schedule for each year of teaching. In theory, teachers on salary steps 1-5 have between 1-5 years of teaching experience (not just in OUSD, but anywhere). However, it is important to note that salary steps are just a proxy and not always exactly equal to years of teaching experience.\n\nPercents are then calculated at the school level by dividing the number of teachers on salary steps 1-5 by the total number of teachers at that school. Schools are placed into groups based on the racial and ethnic breakdown of their student population (see note below data table for full explanation of grouping). Average percent of teachers on salary steps 1-5 is then calculated for each group of schools.",

In December of 2009 Colorado adopted revised academic content standards progressing from early school readiness to postsecondary competencies reflective of both workforce readiness and 21st century skills. In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction. The Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado’s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.",

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\nIn 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.",

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nIn 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.",

                "description": "Citywide Class Size Report, including Region, Program, Grade or Service Category.\r\n\r\nSOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)\r\n#Grade 9 not in high schools\r\n##Indicates how special class is delivered\r\n\r\nFor schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. \r\n\r\nThe following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. \r\n\r\nThe Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",

Accessing the data from Socrata's v2.1 SODA API will access cached data which is only updated hourly. \n\n<b>Additional information:</b>\nFurther information about City of Melbourne's parking sensors can be found <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/parking-and-transport/parking/Pages/parking-faqs.aspx#sensors\">here</a>.\n\n<b>How the data joins:</b>\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, <a href=\"https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/On-street-Parking-Bays/crvt-b4kt\">on-street parking bays</a> and the <a href=\"https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/On-street-Car-Park-Bay-Restrictions/ntht-5rk7/data\">on-street car park bay restrictions</a>. \nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay information by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay information don’t currently join.\n\n<b>Outages</b>\nThis dataset is updated through network relays and can be disrupted causing delays in data updates. Users of this data are encouraged to monitor the dataset's last updated timestamp in the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/api/catalog/v1?ids=vh2v-4nfs' target='_blank'>catalogue API JSON endpoint</a> to check for delays in the data being updated. \n\n<b>Disclaimer</b>\nWhile all due care has been taken to ensure the data of this website is accurate, current and available please note: \n·         there may be errors or omission in it\n·         there may be occasions where the data is not available and/or the website will be unavailable. \n\nThe City of Melbourne and its employees accept no responsibility for any loss, damage, claim, expense, cost or liability whatsoever (including in contract, tort including negligence, pursuant to statue and otherwise) arising in respect of or in connection with accessing, using or reliance upon the data in this website, or the unavailability of the data or the website.",

                "description": "The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Program is a Federal-State cooperative program between the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the California EDD’s Labor Market Information Division (LMID). The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. \r\n\r\nThe QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers. \r\n\r\nData from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California’s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes new QCEW data in its County Employment and Wages news release on a quarterly basis. The BLS also publishes a subset of its quarterly data through the Create Customized Tables system, and full quarterly industry detail data at all geographic levels.",

The performance measures, except cost effectiveness which can only be measured annually, are calculated from data which is reported on federal form OCSE 157.  \r\n\r\nCASES WITH SUPPORT ORDERS\r\nThis metric measures the proportion of IV-D cases with support orders established.\r\n\r\nEquation:\r\nNumber of IV-D Cases with Support Orders divided by Total Number of IV-D Cases\r\n\r\nIV-D Paternity Establishment Percentage:\r\nThis metric measures the proportion of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock is the total number of children in the IV-D caseload in the federal fiscal year born out of wedlock with paternity established or acknowledged divided by the total number of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock.  .\r\n\r\nEquation:\r\nTotal # of Children in IV-D Caseload in the Federal Fiscal Year or, as of the end of the Fiscal Year who were born out of wedlock with Paternity Established or Acknowledged divided by Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload as of the end of the preceding Federal Fiscal Year who were Born Out of Wedlock\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT\r\nThis measure focuses on the proportion of current support due that is collected on IV-D cases. \r\n\r\nEquation:\r\nTotal Dollars Collected for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total Dollars Owed for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS ON ARREARS\r\nThe measure assesses efforts to collect money from those cases with an arrearage due. \r\nThe measure specifically counts paying cases, and not total arrears dollars collected.\r\n\r\nEquation:\r\nTotal number of IV-D cases paying toward arrears during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total number of IV-D cases with arrears due",

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional and county tables for per-capita vehicle miles traveled.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Highway Administration: Highway Statistics Series\r\n2015\r\nTable HM-71; limited to urbanized areas\r\nhttps://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau: Summary File 1\r\n2010\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\n\"Vehicle miles traveled reflects the mileage accrued within the county and not necessarily the residents of that county; even though most trips are due to local residents, additional VMT can be accrued by through-trips. City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas within each metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available outside of other urbanized areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.\r\n\r\nVMT per capita is calculated by dividing VMT by an estimate of the traveling population. The traveling population does not include people living in institutionalized facilities, which are defined by the Census. Because institutionalized population is not estimated each year, the proportion of people living in institutionalized facilities from the 2010 Census was applied to the total population estimates for all years.\"",

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region’s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region’s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation’s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county’s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region’s employment in that same sector.",

It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2018.\r\n\r\nThis dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\r\n\r\nFor information on the current city workforce, with names, positions and salaries, visit the \"Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles\" dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xzkq-xp2w.",

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of work.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census\nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\nForm B08601 (2018 only; place of employment)\nwww.api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. \"Other\" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation.\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Regional mode share was calculated using county modal data and calculating the weighted average based on county populations. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share is broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents. Data for Napa County were not available due to small sample size.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas.",

This data includes time of incident, officer assignment, race/sex of stop subject, and outcome of the stop (\"Action taken\").. Individual pedestrian stops may populate multiple data rows to account for multiple outcomes: \"interview number\" is the unique identifier for every one (1) pedestrian stop.\n\nData Creation: This data is created when CPD completes a pedestrian stop and logs the interview via Contact Cards. Contact Cards are a result of the Collaborative Agreement. Contact Cards are manually entered and may experience lags in data entry.\n\nData Created by: This data is created by the Cincinnati Police Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This data is updated daily.\n\nCincyInsights: The City of Cincinnati maintains an interactive dashboard portal, CincyInsights in addition to our Open Data in an effort to increase access and usage of city data. This data set has an associated dashboard available here: https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/gw5q-kjng\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics  facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati’s Open Data Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets: (1) the last two digits of all addresses have been replaced with “XX,” and in cases where there is a single digit street address, the entire address number is replaced with \"X\"; and (2) Latitude and Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area (but not the exact location) of the incident.",

                "description": "Documents in this collection differ from the bound volumes referred to as “registers.” They are registration records typically appearing in the form of certificates or handwritten statements recording the free status of a Black or multiracial person.  A free person would be required to keep this document with them at all times. If a free person was found without a certificate they could be jailed. Free black men and women carefully guarded these documents in secure places on their person; the registrations that do survive have endured much degradation. The 1793 law required one to obtain a new certificate every three years. Both the registration system and the process of renewal was enforced differently in various Virginia localities. Not all free people registered in their locality.\n\nIf a free person moved to a different county, they were required to obtain a registration for that locality. If they did not, they could be apprehended by the local magistrate and taken to court. Theoretically, a person would submit their registration from their previous place of residence to the court as evidence of their free status. In some cases, a person would not have a registration to submit to the court. Instead they produced some other form of identification proving their free status, for example, a deed of emancipation, a will, an apprenticeship indenture, or an affidavit of someone testifying to their character and status.\n\nRegistrations typically include the free person’s name, sometimes age, a brief physical description, and the circumstances of the person’s freedom or emancipation. If an individual was born free, the record may reference their parents. If emancipated, the record may include former enslaver, place, and date of emancipation. In addition to more formal registrations and certificates in this collection, there are also affidavits that were given by individuals affirming a free person’s status, as well as written descriptions of free people.\n\n\nDescriptions included in this dataset are drawn directly from the original documents and may contain language which is now deemed offensive.",

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional and county tables for per-capita vehicle miles traveled.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nCalifornia Department of Transportation: California Public Road Data/Highway Performance Monitoring System\r\n2001-2015\r\nhttp://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hpms/datalibrary.php\r\n\r\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates\r\nForms E-8 and E-5\r\n2001-2015\r\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-8/\r\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-5/2011-20/view.php\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau: Summary File 1\r\n2010\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nVehicle miles traveled reflects the mileage accrued within the county and not necessarily the residents of that county; even though most trips are due to local residents, additional VMT can be accrued by through-trips. City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas within each metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available outside of other urbanized areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.\r\n\r\nVMT per capita is calculated by dividing VMT by an estimate of the traveling population. The traveling population does not include people living in institutionalized facilities, which are defined by the Census. Because institutionalized population is not estimated each year, the proportion of people living in institutionalized facilities from the 2010 Census was applied to the total population estimates for all years.",

Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county, and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Due to the lack of reported PCI data in 2006, the city of Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.",

The California Highway Patrol classifies a serious injury as any combination of the following: broken bones; dislocated or distorted limbs; severe lacerations; skull, spinal, chest or abdominal injuries that go beyond visible injuries; unconsciousness at or when taken from the scene; or severe burns. This injuries dataset includes serious injury counts for the region and counties, as well as individual collision data.\t\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nCalifornia Highway Patrol: Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nThe data is reported by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), which was accessed via SafeTREC’s Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS). The data was tabulated using provided categories specifying injury level, individuals involved, causes of collision, and location/jurisdiction of collision (for more: http://tims.berkeley.edu/help/files/switrs_codebook.doc). Fatalities were normalized over historic population data from the US Census and American Community Surveys and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data from the Federal Highway Administration.\r\n\r\nFor more regarding reporting procedures and injury classification, see the California Highway Patrol Manual (http://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa/stateCatalog/states/ca/docs/CACHP555Manual_22003ch1-13.pdf).",

                "description": "NNDSS - Table II. Rabies, animal to Rubella, congenital syndrome - 2017.  In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed.  The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\n U: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n*Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n† Case counts for reporting year 2017 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for tuberculosis are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.",

                "description": "This dataset contains model-based county-level estimates for the PLACES 2021 release in GIS-friendly format. PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2019 or 2018 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

                "description": "This dataset contains model-based census tract-level estimates for the PLACES 2021 release. PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

There are a total of 10 trail counters along the Trail that collect total number of users in each section per day. We can use this data for a number of reasons such as: finding our most popular access point, the busiest times on the Trail, and the distribution of cyclist vs. pedestrian Trail users. Thanks to this technology we're able to showcase just how many people use and enjoy the Trail every day. Not just that, we share our data with other interest groups to help advocate for more trails!",

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer, Legler and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic closures to perform facilities upgrade or emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence, Little Italy (formerly Roosevelt) and Northtown reopened in early 2019 in new locations. The library also opened its 81st location, West Loop, in January. Douglass and Jefferson Park were closed for extensive renovations for most of the year. Legler, South Shore and Merlo were also closed for extensive renovations and will remain closed until 2020. In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Chicago Public Library closed facilities to the public March 21, 2020 – June 7, 2020.",

For the current version of this data, please refer to the new version, available here: https://data.cambridgema.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Cases-in-Cambridge-Daily-Snapshot/5dms-3pz8/data \n\nCOVID-19 cases in the City of Cambridge as reported by the Cambridge Public Health Department. This dataset summarizes cases by age cohort and gender.\nCambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) data regarding case counts come directly from MDPH and their surveillance system (MAVEN). We use the language and terminology per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and recent guidance categorizes all confirmed or presumptive positive cases as positive. CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1) Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2) People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3) Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. (e.g, Someone might call their provider with a few symptoms and indicate that they were with someone from Biogen. In this case, the doctor may assume positive for COVID-19 and ask the patient to self-isolate at home for two weeks).\n\nThis is the process that the CPHD, and all local health departments, is following.\n\nTotal positive cases include total deaths. Any count <5 will be suppressed for privacy reasons",

These indicators reflect quality of care inside hospitals and include inpatient mortality for certain procedures and medical conditions; utilization of procedures for which there are questions of overuse, underuse, and misuse; and volume of procedures for which there is some evidence that a higher volume of procedures is associated with lower mortality.\r\nAll the IQI measures were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data beginning 2009. US Census data files provided by AHRQ were used to derive denominators for county level (area level) IQI measures.\r\n\r\nThe mortality, volume and utilization measures IQIs are presented by hospital as rates or counts. Area-level utilization measures are presented by county as rates.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected† notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.   NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.   Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum.\r\n* Case counts for reporting year 2016 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n† Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \n\nNotice:  The total numbers of measles cases in Table 1v for weeks 1-51 in the 2019 data are correct but counts for imported and indigenous categories are incorrect. Measles data for week 52 (in Table 1v) were updated on 02-28-2020 to correct the classification of imported and indigenous. Please see week 52, 2019 data for the correct breakout of imported and indigenous measles cases.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\n\n§ Measles is considered imported if the disease was acquired outside of the United States and is considered indigenous if the disease was acquired anywhere within the United States or it is not known where the disease was acquired.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Before 2019, listeriosis cases in neonates less than or equal to 60 days of age were counted as one case in a mother-infant pair. Beginning in 2019, maternal and neonatal listeriosis cases are being counted separately. Beginning in 2020, confirmed and probable cases are published separately. Prior years included confirmed cases only.",

The requirement is consistent with Open Government and applies to all Territory entities.  The Notifiable Invoices Register, in conjunction with the ACT Government Contracts Register provides transparency about Government purchasing to the community. \n\nNotifiable Invoices are invoices with a value of $25,000 or more for goods, services or works received by the Territory or a Territory entity.  The Territory publishes details of notifiable invoices within 21 days after the end of the month in which the invoice was paid.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor reporting from July 1 2017, the Territory will be including date invoice received in the notifiable invoices register.  A number of points should be taken into account when using this information:\t\t\t\n - For the June 2017 reporting period, this field is the date that a valid invoice was received by the responsible Territory entity, however in small number of cases, it relates to the date the invoices was initially entered into the financial processing system of the Territory entity where known.\t\t\t\n - A small proportion of notifiable invoices do not have date received information recorded.  This is due to a variety of reasons including some cases of scheduled payments under agreements or contracts not having an explicit invoice received date, and several reporting entities not yet being able to transmit to the Territory central finance system the date invoice received.\n\nReporting Entity Key\t\nACT Compulsory Third-Party Insurance Regulator\t\nACTIA : ACT Insurance Authority\nCMTEDD\t: Chief Minister, Treasury, Economic Development Directorate\nCMTEDD-ACTP : Capital Works\nCMTEDD-ED\t: Economic Development\nCMTEDD-SPA : Superannuation Provision Account\nCMTEDD-SS : Shared Services\nCMTEDD-TBA : Territory Banking Account\nCSD : Community Services Directorate\nCSD-Housing\tHousing ACT\nCultural Facilities Corporation\t\nDefault Insurance Fund\t\nED : Education Directorate\nED-CIT : Canberra Institute of Technology\nEPSDD : Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate\nEPSDD-SLA : Suburban Land Authority\nHD : Health Directorate\nJACSD : Justice and Community Safety Directorate\nLegal Aid Commission\t\nLong Service Leave Authority\t\nOffice of the Legislative Assembly\t\nTCCS : Transport Canberra and City Services\nTCCS-ACTION : ACTION\nTCCS-CMA : Capital Metro Agency",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\r\n\r\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\r\n\r\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\r\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\r\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\r\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\r\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\r\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.",

The system also receives negative results for a subset of organisms such as COVID-19. The system contains basic information on characteristics and demographics such as age, zone and gender.\nRecovered is based on the assumption that a case is recovered 14 days after a particular date. For confirmed cases, we used specimen collected date and for probable cases, this is the date reported to Alberta Health.\nInformation such as hospitalizations and ICU admissions are received through enhanced case report forms sent by Alberta Health Services (AHS).\nDisclaimer: The content and format of this report are subject to change. Cases are under investigation and numbers may fluctuate as cases are resolved. Data included in the interactive data application are up-to-date as of midday of the date of posting.\n\nData from https://www.alberta.ca/data/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics-data.csv; updated 2022-07-13 16:08 with data as of end of day 2022-07-11.",

                "description": "The Division of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) was created to consolidate child abuse prevention and juvenile delinquency prevention and early intervention programs within the jurisdiction of a single state agency. Consolidation of these programs is intended to eliminate fragmentation and duplication of contracted prevention and early intervention services for at-risk children, youth, and families:\n\nCommunity Youth Development (CYD) - The CYD program contracts with community-based organizations to develop juvenile delinquency prevention programs in ZIP codes with high juvenile crime rates. Approaches used by communities to prevent delinquency have included mentoring, youth employment programs, career preparation, youth leadership development and recreational activities.  Communities prioritize and fund specific prevention services according to local needs. CYD services are available in 15 targeted Texas ZIP codes.\n\nFamily and Youth Success Program (FAYS) (formerly Services to At-Risk Youth (STAR)) - The FAYS program contracts with community agencies to offer family crisis intervention counseling, short- term emergency respite care, and individual and family counseling. Youth up to age 17 and their families are eligible if they experience conflict at home, truancy or delinquency, or a youth who runs away from home. FAYS services are available in all 254 Texas counties. Each FAYS contractor also provides universal child abuse prevention services, ranging from local media campaigns to informational brochures and parenting classes.\n\nStatewide Youth Services Network (SYSN) - The SYSN program contracts provide community and evidence-based juvenile delinquency prevention programs focused on youth ages 10 through 17, in each DFPS region.\n\nNOTE:  For FY15, as a result of a new procurement, the overall number of youth served decreased however the service requirements were enhanced with additional programmatic components.\n\nData as of January 25, 2022.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Arboviral diseases, neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive, West Nile virus disease to Babesiosis - 2019.In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Admissions are the start of a clinical episode of care within a provider. A person may be admitted to more than one program; thus, admissions are not counts of people admitted in a given year. The information reflects data collected and does not account for subsequent audits or amendments that may occur after initial processing.

Over 700 citizens participated in 53 events led by 90 volunteer ecologists and experts. It gave Melburnians the unique opportunity to work alongside professional and amateur naturalists to discover Melbourne's biodiversity and help to produce a list of species living in our city.\r\n\r\nThe City of Melbourne has analysed the data collected in past BioBlitzes and is now building a baseline dataset against which future changes in biodiversity can be measured and evaluated.",

The PSIs were developed by AHRQ after a comprehensive literature review, analysis of ICD-9-CM codes, review by a clinician panel, implementation of risk adjustment, and empirical analyses.\r\n\r\nAll PSI measures were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data beginning 2009.  US Census data files provided by AHRQ were used to derive denominators for county level (area level) PSI measures.\r\n\r\nThe mortality, volume and utilization measures PSIs are presented by hospital as rates or counts.

                "description": "This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) neighborhood poverty group. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-poverty.csv \n\n\nExposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.\n\nThese data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.\n\nIn addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)\n\nNeighborhood-level poverty groups were classified in a manner consistent with Health Department practices to describe and monitor disparities in health in NYC. Neighborhood poverty measures are defined as the percentage of people earning below the Federal Poverty Threshold (FPT) within a ZCTA. The standard cut-points for defining categories of neighborhood-level poverty in NYC are:\n•\tLow: <10% of residents in ZCTA living below the FPT\n•\tMedium: 10% to <20%\n•\tHigh: 20% to <30%\n•\tVery high: ≥30% residents living below the FPT\nThe ZCTAs used for classification reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.\n\nRates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. Rates for poverty were calculated using direct standardization for age at diagnosis and weighting by the US 2000 standard population.\nAntibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.\n\nData are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certain",

French Immerion students write a French translation of this assessment. Students answered questions in each of the mathematics strands (number and operations, patterns and relations, measurement and geometry, and data management and probability). Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) and Level 4 (above the expectation).Students also received a scaled score in mathematics (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800).  Nova Scotia teachers worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to develop this assessment and to set the performance expectation, which is what students should know and be able to do on their own at the end of grade 8."

Students answered questions in each of the mathematics strands (number and operations, patterns and relations, measurement and geometry, and statistics and probability). Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) and Level 4 (above the expectation).Students also received a scaled score in mathematics (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800).  Nova Scotia teachers worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to develop this assessment and to set the performance expectation, which is what students should know and be able to do on their own at the beginning of grade 4.

The centroid of each footprint was used to join a property identifier from a draft of the San Francisco Enterprise GIS Program's cartographic base, which provides continuous coverage with distinct right-of-way areas as well as selected nearby parcels from adjacent counties.
