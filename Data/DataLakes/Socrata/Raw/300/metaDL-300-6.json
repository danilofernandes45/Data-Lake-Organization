Sites participating in these flexibilities are indicated in the newly added <b><i>COVID Meal Site</b></i> column of this dataset. For more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b>This dataset only represents claims submitted by CACFP sites operating as At-Risk Child Care Centers.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Adult Day Care Centers, Child Care Centers, Head Start centers, emergency shelters, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all CACFP data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/iekx-7mdi target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Child and Adult Care Food Programs</a></b> page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b> page. <p>\n\n<b>More information about accessing and working with TDA data on the Texas Open Data Portal</b> can be found on the SquareMeals.org website on the <b><a href=http://www.squaremeals.org/FandNResources/PublicInformationRequests/TDAFoodandNutritionOpenData.aspx target=\"_blank\">TDA Food and Nutrition Open Data</a> </b>page.<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.<p>\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP), and the summer meal programs.

NWS forecasters issue approximately 2,900 Tornado Warnings per year, primarily between the Rockies and Appalachian Mountains. Tornado Warning statistics are based on a comparison of warnings issued and weather spotter observations of tornadoes and/or storm damage surveys from Weather Forecast Offices in the United States. \n\nAccuracy or probability of detection (POD) is the percentage of time a tornado actually occurred in an area that was covered by a tornado warning. The difference between the accuracy percentage figure and 100% represents the percentage of events occurring without warning. \n\nMost tornadoes cannot be visually tracked from beginning to end and post-storm damage surveying is the official method with which the NWS categorizes tornado characteristics (intensity, path length & width) but must rely on radar data to estimate the timing of the tornado track.",

An “interested party” is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the \"Payors Information\" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission. The parent filing and form data is available in a separate dataset: \"SFEC Form 3610b - City Officer Behested Payment - Filings\" at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Form-3610b-City-Officer-Behested-Payment-Fili/7vmk-cq9e.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Because the Chicago building code has since 1975 required new high-rise residential buildings to be constructed with sprinkler systems, the Life Safety Ordinance mostly impacted high-rise residential buildings constructed prior to 1975.  This dataset does not describe the overall safety of a building, only whether or not the life safety evaluation was submitted and approved by the City of Chicago. Please note that the majority of reports “failed” initially as a result of a new reporting process and changes to building standards.",

                "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2016 calendar year.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown data issues: \r\n\r\n1. There are 342,475 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \r\n\r\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \r\n\r\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \r\n\r\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \r\n\r\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \r\n\r\nData that is excluded: \r\n\r\nIn the 2016 car parking event data there are 4,346 records where the parking event goes into 2017 and ends at midnight.",

This online dashboard displays information related to how safe Chicago residents feel and how much trust they have in the police.\n\nThe dashboard and this dataset are updated monthly and users are able to view data citywide, as well as within the five detective areas and in each of the 22 districts. Users can sort this data based on year, month and location. Information is also available based on demographics, including age, sex, race, education and income level. The dashboard is meant to improve transparency as well as work toward compliance with the consent decree.\n\nThe first five columns indicate the type of organizational unit described by the records and which particular unit. Subsequent columns show either a safety or trust score for a demographic group. Scores are derived from responses to survey questions, with each response being a value that ranges from 0-10. Please note that Elucd trust and safety scores are NOT a percentage. A score of 65 means that average response to the questions is 6.5 out of 10. The final two columns show the time period in which the data were collected.\n\nThe dataset was created by our partner, Elucd (https://elucd.com), through delivering short surveys to Chicago residents through digital ads. See [https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard_FAQ_11_25_20.pdf] for more information on the project.\n\nThis effort is one element of a Chicago Police Department reform process, governed by a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago. For more information on the consent decree, see https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html.",

                "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset was first created as part of the SFMTA On Street Car Share Pilot Program (approved by the MTA Board in July 2013) to illustrate the location of implemented and planned (various stages) spaces throughout the city.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY  The locations were originally provided to the MTA as requests by the three car share organizations (CSOs). These were given as a .kml file, which was converted to a .shp. Additional fields were created using spatial joins (zipcode, supervisor district, CNN, etc). Use definition query tool to display those locations with a certain attribute. For example, query Existing = 1 to display those locations that are on street operating. 500 submissions were given by CSOs to the MTA, but only a portion of those were brought to the MTA Board for approval, and even fewer were implemented as operational on street spaces. With no definition query, you can see all spaces as features, with varying levels of data completion. \n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  During periods of implementation/construction, updates were as frequent as daily or weekly. However, as the frequency of newly implemented spaces slowed over the course of the pilot, updates occurred less frequently--weekly or monthly. Updates will be needed as new spaces are implemented--many of the spaces not taken past MTA Board approval have incomplete data.  \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Each feature (or each row, or point) represents a single car share parking space. Some parking spaces belong to a \"pod\" where there are two adjacent car share parking spaces, indicated by the \"PodType\" field. To summarize or analyze by pod, use the \"POD\" field.",

This does not represent the number of individuals tested, as some people are tested multiple times over time because of the risk of frequent exposure. Source: California Reportable Disease Information Exchange. Data notes: The daily average rate of tests is the daily average number of tests completed over the past 7 days per 100,000 people served by the individual healthcare system. The State of California has defined an initial goal of at least 150 tests per day per 100,000 people. Bay Area County Health Officers set a goal of 200 tests per day per 100,000 people. \n\nThis table was updated for the last time on May 20, 2021.",

Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety.  AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021. Region 6A is Harris County and Region 6B is Region 6 excluding Harris County. \n\nStages that were administratively closed or closed to merge were excluded from this report.\n\nThis dashboard addresses Texas Family Code Section 264.017 (b) (3).",

The call data does not contain the nature of the emergency or dispatched resources. For dispatch data reference Police Calls for Service (CAD) or Cincinnati Fire Incidents (CAD).\n\nData Creation: This dataset includes both emergency (911) and administrative calls to the center. To obtain just emergency (911) calls filter for Call Type ID = 911 CALLS.\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the City of Cincinnati's Call System provided by West Communications.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset updates weekly on Fridays.\n\nCincyInsights: The City of Cincinnati maintains an interactive dashboard portal, CincyInsights in addition to our Open Data in an effort to increase access and usage of city data. This data set has an associated dashboard available here: https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/snnn-n6ic\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati’s Open Data Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets: (1) the last two digits of all addresses have been replaced with “XX,” and in cases where there is a single digit street address, the entire address number is replaced with \"X\"; and (2) Latitude and Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area (but not the exact location) of the incident.",

An exposure element, such as the number of vehicles using the roadway over a given time and distance, generally is combined with number of crashes to obtain a crash rate.  Neither the exposure element nor the crash rate is provided in the dataset.  The number of crashes at one facility should not be measured against the number of crashes at another facility, nor should it be compared to other highways or non-Port Authority facilities.  Each facility varies in geometric and operational characteristics, therefore the roadway environment and operational conditions to drivers are different, which means there are different contributing factors that influence the number of crashes."

                "description": "The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) oversees more than 250 state parks, historic sites, recreational trails, golf courses, boat launches and more,  encompassing nearly 350,000 acres, that are visited by 74 million people annually.  These facilities contribute to the economic vitality and quality of life of local communities and directly support New York’s tourism industry.  Parks also provide a place for families and children to be active and exercise, promoting healthy lifestyles.  The agency is responsible for the operation and stewardship of the state park system as well as advancing a statewide parks, historic preservation, and open space mission.  \n\nThe New York State Historic Preservation Office maintains the list of New York State’s National Register of Historic Places. The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of preservation. Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 ( Federal Regulation 36 CFR 60 ) the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's historic and archeological resources. To be considered eligible, a building, district, structure or object must meet the National Register Criteria for Evaluation. This involves examining the property’s age, integrity, and significance. Please see metadata for additional information, including how to access the agency’s Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS) which provides access to the agency’s database of historic records associated with each project listing in this dataset.",

                "description": "Data Description: The National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) is a reporting standard that fire departments nationwide use to uniformly report on the full range of fire department activities. This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2015.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State’s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati’s Open Data Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets: (1) the last two digits of all addresses have been replaced with “XX,” and in cases where there is a single digit street address, the entire address number is replaced with \"X\"; and (2) Latitude and Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area (but not the exact location) of the incident.",

The NYPD has provided this data to the New York City Department of Education (DOE). The DOE has compiled this data by schools and locations for the information of our parents and students, our teachers and staff, and the general public. \r\nIn some instances, several Department of Education learning communities co-exist within a single building. In other instances, a single school has locations in several different buildings. In either of these instances, the data presented here is aggregated by building location rather than by school, since safety is always a building-wide issue. We use “consolidated locations” throughout the presentation of the data to indicate the numbers of incidents in buildings that include more than one learning community.",

                "description": "Buddy Benches are currently used to encourage inclusion in elementary schools, and the City of Edmonton is hoping the same principle can help reduce urban isolation in our city. On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the “Hello, How Are You?” (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school’s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying “Hello, how are you?”\r\n\r\nAge Friendly Edmonton Partnership\r\nIn a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city. These benches are specifically painted and wrapped in vinyl. Visit a bench today and make sure to say “Hello, How are you?”.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on Buddy Benches, please go to: https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/buddy-benches.aspx",

The associated metadata and additional data can be downloaded below under \"Attachments\".\n\nResearchers for the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)  program collected detailed vehicle trajectory data on southbound US 101 and Lankershim Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA, eastbound I-80 in Emeryville, CA and Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. Data was collected through a network of synchronized digital video cameras. NGVIDEO, a customized software application developed for the NGSIM program, transcribed the vehicle trajectory data from the video. This vehicle trajectory data provided the precise location of each vehicle within the study area every one-tenth of a second, resulting in detailed lane positions and locations relative to other vehicles.

                "description": "<b>About the Dataset</b><br>\nThis data set contains claims information for <b> meal reimbursement for CACFP participating as Day Care Homes for program year 2019-2020.</b> The CACFP program year begins October 1 and ends September 30. <p>\n\nIn March 2020, USDA began allowing flexibility in nutrition assistance program policy to support continued meal access should the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) impact meal service operation. Sites participating in these flexibilities are indicated in the newly added <b><i>COVID Meal Site</b></i> column of this dataset. For more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b> This dataset only includes claims submitted by CACFP sites participating as Day Care Homes.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Child Care Centers, At-Risk Child Care Centers, Head Start Centers, emergency shelters, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all CACFP data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/iekx-7mdi target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Child and Adult Care Food Programs</a></b> page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b> page. <p>\n\n<b>More information about accessing and working with TDA data on the Texas Open Data Portal</b> can be found on the SquareMeals.org website on the <b><a href=http://www.squaremeals.org/FandNResources/PublicInformationRequests/TDAFoodandNutritionOpenData.aspx target=\"_blank\">TDA Food and Nutrition Open Data</a> </b>page.<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.<p>\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP),and the summer meal programs.

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nIn 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.",

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\nIn 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.",

Children NOT enrolled at an NSLP participating location cannot technically be approved for free or reduced-price lunches. \r\n3. The Report is created on January 30th. \r\n4. The data provided here is NOT equivalent to NCLB indicators that are uploaded to SAIS. \r\n5. Cells with an asterisk(*) indicate data has been suppressed to meet FERPA requirements. \r\n6.

MBE and WBE are terms of art under CMC 324, and refer specifically to the City's new Economic Inclusion program. \n\nTo increase economic participation in City contracts for minority- and women-owned businesses, the City enacted C.M.C 324, which authorized creation of the City’s new Economic Inclusion Program, run by the Department of Economic Inclusion (DEI). DEI works with Procurement and City departments to establish subcontracting goals for minority & women-owned businesses to help bolster the City's other inclusion efforts.\n\nData Creation: DEI certifies vendors through its Business Certification Programs: the process of being certified under C.M.C. 324 and 342 is explained on the Department's website. The active vendors are sent to the Office of Performance and Data Analytics\n\nData Created By: Department of Economic Inclusion (DEI)\n\nRefresh Frequency: Weekly\n\nCincyInsights: The City of Cincinnati maintains an interactive dashboard portal, CincyInsights in addition to our Open Data in an effort to increase access and usage of city data. This data set has an associated dashboard available here: https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Certified-Vendors-MBE-WBE-Program-/69yt-tb5j/\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible.

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector. This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region’s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region’s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation’s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county’s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region’s employment in that same sector.",

Refer to other datasets to get actual values for any of the reports referenced herewith.\n\nFor candidates, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily the year the report was filed. For political committees, the number of years is determined by the calendar year of the reporting period.\n\nThis dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.\n\nDescriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.\n\nCONDITION OF RELEASE: This publication and or referenced documents constitutes a list of individuals prepared by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission and may not be used for commercial purposes.

Sin embargo, la unidad que se maneja de manera estadística a nivel nacional o internacional es la onza troy la cual equivale a 31,1034768 gramos.\r\n•\tLa compensación es una contraprestación económica que se fija contractualmente y que no corresponde a una producción de mineral.",

                "description": "The following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term “collection_week” signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a “collection_week” of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either “_coverage”, “_sum”, or “_avg”.\n<ul>\n<li>A “_coverage” append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A “_sum” append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A “_avg” append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with “-999,999”.\n\n<b>A story page was created to display both corrected and raw datasets and can be accessed at this link: https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/nhgk-5gpv </b>\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.</li></ul>\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\n<ul>\n<li>hhs_ids\n<li>previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n<li>previous_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\n<li>previous_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum</li></ul>\n\nOn May 8, 2021, this data set is the originally reported numbers by the facility. This data set may contain data anomalies due to data key entries. \n\nOn May 13, 2021 Changed vaccination fields from sum to max or min fields. This reflects the maximum or minimum number reported for that metric in a given week.\n\nOn June 7, 2021 Changed vaccination fields from max or min fields to Wednesday reported only. This reflects that the number reported for that metric is only reported on Wednesdays in a given week.\n\nOn January 19, 2022, the following fields have been added to this dataset: \n<ul>\n<li>inpatient_beds_used_covid_7_day_avg\n<l",

The primary types of application, aka job type, are: New Building, Demolition, and Alterations Type 1, 2, and 3. Each job type can have multiple work types, such as general construction, boiler, elevator, and plumbing. Each work type will receive a separate permit. (See the DOB Job Application Filings dataset for information about each job application.) Each row/record in this dataset represents the life cycle of one permit for one work type.

Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a\nranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.\n\nIn addition to tract-level rankings, SVI also has corresponding rankings at the\ncounty level. Notes below that describe “tract” methods also refer to county methods. The following counties in this dataset are : Bastrop,  Hays, Travis, Williamson for the following years 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018. Data for 2010 is missing uninsured and disabled data.",

These estimates do not include self-employed and private household employees.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2018\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: LODES Data\nLongitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program (2005-2010)\nhttp://lehd.ces.census.gov/\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n5-Year Estimates, Tables S0804 (2010) and B08604 (2010-2017)\nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\nTable D-3: Employees on nonfarm payrolls (1990-2018)\nhttp://www.bls.gov/data/\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment, by place of employment, for California counties. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from monthly estimates and thus reflect “annual average employment.” Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.\n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.\n\nThe following incorporated cities and towns are included in each sub-county area:\nNorth Alameda County – Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont\nEast Alameda County - Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton\nSouth Alameda County - Fremont, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, Union City\nCentral Contra Costa County - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek\nEast Contra Costa County - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg\nWest Contra Costa County - El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, San Pablo\nMarin – all incorporated cities and towns\nNapa – all incorporated cities and towns\nSan Francisco – San Francisco\nNorth San Mateo - Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Millbrae, Pacifica, San Bruno, South San Francisco\nCentral San Mateo - Belmont, Burlingame, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, San Carlos, San Mateo\nSouth San Mateo - East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside\nNorth Santa Clara - Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale\nSan Jose – San Jose\nSouthwest Santa Clara - Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga\nSouth Santa Clara - Gilroy, Morgan Hill\nEast Solano - Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville\nSouth Solano - Benicia, Vallejo\nNorth Sonoma - Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor\nSouth Sonoma - Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma",

                "description": "Data Description: To reduce the expose to lead in drinking water, Greater Cincinnati Water Works (GCWW) has created a Lead Service Line Replacement Program (LSLRP). In October 2016, GCWW was directed by the City of Cincinnati Council, via Ordinance No. 326-2016, to take the appropriate steps to develop, fund, and implement a program to replace known lead service lines in the City, both on public and private property. Through another ordinance, Ordinance No. 185-2017, and effective July 28, 2017, lead service lines are prohibited in the GCWW system. Enforcement of this ban is being phased in over time.\n\nThe private-side work is then done by contractors or plumbers who are contracted with GCWW through the City's procurement process, either for a water main replacement project, or from a pre-qualified list established through the City's Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process. This dataset is the list of jobs from the pre-qualified list of plumbers established through the RFQ process.\n\nData Creation: This data set is the list of jobs from the pre-qualified list of plumbers established through the RFQ process.\n\nData Created By: GCWW\n\nRefresh Frequency:\n\nFor more information on the GCWW Lead Service Line Replacement Program please visit the GCWW Lead Awareness site https://lead.mygcww.org. If you are a plumber and are interested in learning more about how you can get involved, please view the Plumber FAQ.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this data set.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad",

Scale-up storage is a storage product comprised of a discreet storage controller (with or without redundancy), which has a full view of all the storage devices in the storage product. Incremental storage capacity is added by the addition of storage devices under the control of the existing storage controller.  While Scale-out storage is a storage product capable of being comprised of two or more discreet storage controllers (with or without redundancy), combined with an overall integration or aggregation function resulting in a single storage product view for attached servers. Each discreet storage controller often has a partial view to a partition of the overall system's storage devices, but this is not a fixed requirement. Incremental storage capacity is added by the addition of storage devices under the control of the existing storage controller(s) and/or addition of additional storage devices along with additional controller(s).",

The change could be an increase or a decrease in wages. For example, if an individual completed training in the third quarter of 2013 and earned $5,000 in that quarter and earned $7,500 in the third quarter of 2014 the percent change for that individual would be 50%.

The top line of the file includes the overall percentage change for all trainings. \n\n*The goal for Labor & Industry is based on receiving $10 million to fund Industry Partnerships. \n\nThis dataset is for Program Year 2013-2017 and will be updated annually due to federal release schedule.\nThere are many reasons why an individual’s wage may have changed dramatically.

                "description": "Purpose: This data exists in order to track the number of cycles swept annually of protected bikeways.  Source: Completed Protected Bike Lane reports are received from ATD. ARR then tracks internally the number of sweeping cycles completed. \nContains: The linear miles (measured in curb miles) of protected bikeways swept by street sweepers. Curb miles represent the length of streets along the curb. Since bikeways can be one-way (one side of the street) or two-way (both sides of the street), curb miles count full distances (a two-way bikeway will measure both sides of the street, i.e. both curbs). Curb miles that were swept are counted monthly, and can exceed the available curb miles when bikeways are swept more than once in the same month. Available curb miles are counted quarterly.  Usage: This data set can be used in determining budget and resource allocation.  In addition, it is used to track how many full sweep cycles are completed in a given fiscal year.

This data is obtained from individuals sampled in obtaining data for the ACT Household Travel Survey. \n\nA trip is defined as the travel between two main activities, where a stop may constitute a change in transport mode. As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \n\nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday, and average times include wait times at transport interchanges. The main method of travel across a trip is used to classify trip types. The time of day is based on the mid-point of the start and arrival time of the trip. \nAM Peak: 8-9AM, PM Peak: 5-6PM",

                "description": "The Oregon Department of Energy’s Energy Incentive Program issued tax credits to Oregon businesses, public agencies, and nonprofits that invested in energy conservation or transportation projects. The Energy Incentive Program tax credits ended (sunset) at the end of the 2017 tax year, which was dependent on the applicants’ tax year. \nWhile the program sunset in 2017 and is no longer accepting applications, reporting will continue until projects with multi-year tax credits/recertification’s are complete. This report covers July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2021. Withdrawn, Denied, Inactive, and Expired projects are excluded. \nNotes: *The report shows tax credits issued & may differ from tax credits allowed due to rounding. * Commercial conservation projects with project costs under $20,000 were administered under the Small Premium Projects (SPP) program. For SPP projects, ODOE used predetermined tax credit amounts based on a project's anticipated energy savings, up to a maximum credit of $7,000 per project. The tax credit could not exceed 35 percent of the certified costs.\n* Commercial, agricultural, and industrial conservation projects with project costs greater than $20,000 were administered through a competitive process.\n* Tax credits offered through the transportation program could go to fleets for projects that replaced or modified two or more vehicles to use alternative fuels, or to projects that installed or constructed a facility for mixing, storing, compressing, or dispensing fuels for alternative fuel vehicles, including electric charging, compressed natural gas, and propane fueling stations. \nFor more information visit the Oregon Department of Energy website.  \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/energy/Incentives/Pages/default.aspx",

Emissions are reported annually through the <a href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a> platform, which is a requirement of Global Covenant of Mayors and C40 membership. \n\nEmission sources are broken down across the sectors: Stationary energy, Transportation and Waste. They are categorized by their \"scope\" which distinguishes between emissions that physically occur within the city (scope 1), from those that occur from the use of electricity and supplied by grids potentially crossing city boundaries (scope 2), from those that occur outside the city but are driven by activities taking place within the city’s boundaries (scope 3). All GHG emissions are presented in units of metric tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).\n \nIn cases where there are limitations on data availability notation keys have been used. NO indicates that an activity or process does not occur or exist within the city. IE signifies GHG emissions for this activity are presented in another category of the inventory. NE is used when emissions occur but have not been estimated or reported due to unavailability of data.\n\nPreparing and reporting this data helps us to understand where the city's emissions come from. It allows us to plan our emission reduction activities to take effective action to mitigate climate change.",

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

No route predictions can be made. Equivalent to an error status. “HistoryMissing” - Predictions cannot be made as there is no historical data available for at least one segment. Historical data is needed to predict changes in travel times for downstream segments. No route predictions can be made.

Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified on an ongoing basis. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database as they are identified. Types of stations include: Private Stations, Biodiesel Stations, Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations, Natural Gas Stations. Stations accommodate either light-duty vehicles only (i.e., passenger vehicles, light-duty pickups, and utility vans), vehicles up to Class 5 (i.e., box trucks and cargo vans), or all vehicle sizes and classes."

The data is categorised based on the cause of the vehicle stop. \nA trip is defined as the travel between two main activities, where a stop may constitute a change in transport mode. As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday.",

The department evaluates the  condition of highway pavement based on how many years remain before reconstruction is necessary. A good condition rating means there is a remaining service life of 11 or more years; a fair rating indicates a remaining service life of six through 10 years; and, a poor evaluation represents a remaining service life of less than six years. CDOT’s surface treatment program is generally able to achieve the target established by the Transportation Commission at the beginning of each year. The annual target continues to be established each year at a level lower than the prior year’s actual level, which is indicative of the continued system deterioration caused by insufficient investment in surface treatment. Pavement maintenance is generally provided from discretionary CDOT funds. Just less than one half of CDOT’s funds are restricted (e.g. FASTER-Bridge funds are dedicated for bridges by state legislation, federally earmarked funds are dedicated for certain significant improvement projects, etc.)"

While most points represent a single accessible site, a few represent a destination grouping of nearby and related accessible facilities. Based on staff inspections, sites without any features meeting proposed ADAAG for Outdoor Areas or that do not provide meaningful access to recreation were omitted. All attributes were manually entered, based on staff inspections. Sites were inspected by DEC staff, trained in the ADAAG Proposed Guidelines for Outdoor Recreation Areas (United States Access Board, 2007)."

                "description": "The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) sought to accelerate the adoption of Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs) by working to develop supply chains and expand service networks to make them available in the market and supported by key actors, such as ASHP installation contractors. When initially launched, NYSERDA’s now closed ASHP Program provided incentives to solely Participating Installers for the installation of Program Qualified ASHP systems. NYSERDA’s Air-Source Heat Pump Program provided nearly $14,950,000 in incentives to Participating Installers for the installation of Program Qualified Air Source Heat Pump systems. The New York State Public Service Commission allocated funding for this program through the Clean Energy Fund (CEF) to expand the ASHP market in New York and to support installations for customers who pay (or will pay in the case of new construction) the System Benefit Charge (SBC)/CEF surcharge on their electricity bills. Incentives were available per installed Program Qualified ASHP system to Participating Installers on a first-come, first-served basis. Incentives included those that may have been retained by the Participating Installer as well as additional incentives that were paid to the Participating Installer but credited to site owners. \r\n\r\nThe NYSERDA-Supported Air Source Heat Pump Projects: 2017-2019 dataset contains characteristics about each ASHP project that participated in a NYSERDA ASHP program.\r\n\r\nNYSERDA offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and accelerate economic growth. reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.) Participants may make lump-sum contributions. No individuals on active duty in the Armed Forces may initially begin contributing to this program after March 31, 1987.</p>",

This table displays the count and percent, by county, of Veterans who are farmers and/or dairymen comparative for the entire state's population of Veteran farmers or dairymen in California for 2015. The data was created from our administrative database U.S. Veterans Eligibility Trends and Statistics (USVETS), for the recent event Apps for Ag Hackathon.  \n\n\nThe U.S. Veterans Eligibility Trends and Statistics (USVETS) is the single integrated dataset of Veteran demographic and socioeconomic data. It provides the most comprehensive picture of the Veteran population possible to support statistical, trend and longitudinal analysis. USVETS has both a static dataset, represents a single authoritative record of all living and deceased Veterans, and fiscal year datasets, represents a snapshot of a Veteran for each fiscal year. USVETS consists mainly of data sources from the Veterans Benefit Administration, the Veterans Health Administration, the Department of Defense’s Defense Manpower Data Center, and other data sources including commercial data sources. This dataset contains information about individual Veterans including demographics, details of military service, VA benefit usage, and more. The dataset contains one record per Veteran. It includes all living and deceased Veterans. USVETS data includes Veterans residing in states, US territories and foreign countries. VA uses this database to conduct statistical analytics, predictive modeling, and other data reporting. USVETS includes the software, hardware, and the associated processes that produce various VA work products and related files for Veteran analytics.",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.)

Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2016 Integrated Report.  Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered \"impaired\". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the \"303(d) Impaired Waters Report\", commonly referred to as the \"impaired waters list.\" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, \"Total Maximum Daily Load,\" or \"TMDL\"). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",

The Division provides technical assistance, administers variances, delivers educational courses, oversees the enforcement practices of local governments and serves as secretariat to the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council.  The Division program was created by Chapter 707 of the Laws of 1981.  The New York Legislature enacted Article 18 of the Executive Law, directing the formulation of a Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code).  The Uniform Code is designed to cover new construction, building rehabilitation, fire safety, and housing maintenance. \n\nThis dataset provides annually reported data on administration and enforcement of the Uniform Code in each local government jurisdiction pursuant to 19 NYCRR 1203.",

For example, a county might have included figures for towns and villages for which it administered the Uniform Code.  Local governments may submit revised reports.  When the Division receives a revised report, it marks the first submission replaced.  The listing only displays the most current submission provided by the local government.  Prior to 2018, multiple reports were received from some local governments with incomplete information.  Generally, this would happen when one department, such as a fire department, was responsible for annual fire safety inspections and another, such as a building department, was responsible for other code enforcement activity.  From 2016 to 2017, online reports included questions specifically addressed to which functions the report covered.  Prior to 2016, this coverage was imputed algorithmically or manually based on which portions of the report form were completed.

We proposed and executed the Really Grate Tree Project to help us understand how these trees survive and to experiment with methods to improve their growth.

The number prefixes are part of the chemical name describing the isomer ( ions or molecules with identical formulas but distinct structures ) part of the name.  For example - 1,2,3,4,5,6 refer to the positions on the cyclohexane molecule where a chlorine atom is substituted for a hydrogen.  The carbon atoms on the cyclohexane ring can be numbered 1 through 6.  Due to the symmetry of this particular molecule, it doesn’t really matter where we start counting on the ring.  What does matter is that each number is only mentioned once, which means there is only 1 chlorine atom attached to each carbon.  One can envision other forms of Hexachlorocyclohexane in which multiple chlorines are attached to a single carbon atom.  For example: 1,1,2,2,3,3 Hexachlorocyclohexane would have two chlorine atoms attached to each of 3 sequential carbon atoms, with none on the other three…  Now 1,2,3,4,5,6 Hexachlorocyclohexane can refer to a mixture of isomers of that molecule.  This is because the ring of cyclohexane’s carbon atoms locks the attached hydrogens and chlorines onto one side of the ring, and this naming convention is not specific enough to tell which chlorine atoms are locked “above” the ring and which are “below it”.  So in order to know which specific isomer we are talked about, a more specific name is required.  This is where the other numbers can help.  “58-89-9” is the  Chemical Abstracts Service (registration) number, sometimes abbreviated CAS # or CASRN.  This is really not part of the name of the molecule, but rather a unique serial number assigned to the molecule.  The number itself is pretty much arbitrarily assigned by the American Chemical Society, but it is important in that it is unique, like a bar code for the molecule.  The number is typically written in 3 parts separated by dashes, with two to seven digits in the first part, two in the second, and one in the third.  If we google CAS#58-89-9  we find out that we are working with the “gamma” isomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6 Hexachlorocyclohexane where the chlorines are arranged around the ring in an up-up-down-up-up-down configuration.

The site lists over 400 businesses (mostly local) that accept products and materials for recycling or proper disposal. Business details include location (with mapping), contact information, hours of operation, restrictions, fees and more. The goal of \"What do I do with...?\" is to reduce the volume of reusable or recyclable items being added to the waste-stream, thereby reducing the environmental impact of those items while extending the lifespan of our landfills.",

Members of the public interested in the identity of a specific incident may contact ACRC directly to inquire about the incident and, if it is closed, ACRC will release a copy of the file to the person requesting it. However, location data regarding where the incident was reported or occurred is included within this data set, which may or may not be the same location as the animal owner's home or property.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to protect the identity of the complainant (person filing the complaint or alerting ACRC to a potential incident), only the complainant's street name is included as part of this data set. \r\n\r\nFinally, while all incidents are updated on a daily basis, incidents involving animal cruelty are updated based on a rolling 30-day delay to allow for ACRC to investigate the incident and make a determination as to the validity of the cruelty complaint.",

                "description": "The Chicago Park District collects and analyzes water samples from beaches along Chicago’s Lake Michigan lakefront. The Chicago Park District partners with the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Public Health Laboratory to analyze water samples using a new DNA testing method called Rapid Testing Method (qPCR analysis) which tests for Enterococci in order to monitor swimming safety. \n \nThe rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a 4-5 hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 1000* CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow swim advisory flag is implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation).\n \nHistorically, the Chicago Park District used the culture based analysis method and statistical prediction models to monitor beach water quality. \nThe culture based method tests for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. The Chicago Park District would use results of the culture based method to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 235* CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented. This standard is still used at most beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.\n \nThe statistical prediction model forecasted real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). The Chicago Park District would use results of the predictive model to notify the public when bacteria levels would exceed 235 CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented.\n \n* The unit of measurement for Escherichia coli is Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 milliliters of water. (Culture Based Method / Statistical Prediction Model)\n*The unit of measuring DNA is Enterococci Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) per 100 milliliters of water. (Rapid Testing Analysis)",

                "description": "This dataset contains all ShotSpotter alerts since the introduction of ShotSpotter to some Chicago Police Department (CPD) districts in 2017. ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system designed to automatically determine the location of potential outdoor gunfire. ShotSpotter audio sensors are placed in several CPD districts throughout the city (specific districts are noted below). If at least three sensors detect a sound that the ShotSpotter software determines to be potential gunfire, a location is determined and the alert is sent to human ShotSpotter analysts for review. Either the alert is sent to CPD, or it is dismissed. Each alert can contain multiple rounds of gunfire; sometimes there are multiple alerts for what may be determined to be one incident. More detail on the technology and its accuracy can be found on the company’s website <a href=\"https://www.shotspotter.com\">here</a>. It should also be noted that ShotSpotter alerts may increase year-over-year while gun violence did not necessarily increase accordingly because of improvements in detection sensors.\r\n\r\nShotSpotter does not exist in every CPD district, and it was not rolled out in every district at the same time. ShotSpotter was first deployed in Chicago in 2017, and sensors exist in the following districts as of the May 2021 launch of this dataset: 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 015, and 025.",

The domains (Preventive Care, Quality of Care, Quality of Life, Resident Safety and Resident Status) encompass twenty-four different quality measures. A Domain Rating assesses performance over all the measures within that domain, with 5 stars indicating the highest performance and 1 star the lowest performance.  The Overall Rating is a normalized star rating based on the Nursing Homes' performance across the five domains. The normalization of the Overall Rating resets the distribution, with the highest performing Nursing Homes across all the domains having 5 stars and the lowest performing Nursing Homes across the five domains having 1 star. New York’s Nursing Home Domain Rating differs from CMS’ 5-star rating in data reporting period and in methodology.",

The rates for nursing homes are not reported if the nursing home sample size is too small or is not made available by CMS. If this data is used for trending, the changes in measure specification, the deletion or addition of measures, should be considered.

SMM data are derived from linking NYC birth certificates for births occurring at NYC facilities with the mother's delivery hospitalization record from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. SMM is identified using an established algorithm developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that comprises 21 indicators that represent diagnoses of serious complications of pregnancy or delivery or procedures used to manage serious conditions. Each record represents the aggregated number and rate of SMM events in the population group specified for the year specified.",

                "description": "Estimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.",

These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Race/Ethnicity, and by whether their exit from care occurred within 24 months of their entry to care or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  Please note that these figures do not represent unique children, and so should not be used as the basis for creating a rate based on the child population of the state.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F. Consent Decree Exit Plan Outcome #9: Transfer of Guardianship Within 24 Months, although those figures are reported to the DCF Court Monitor on a quarterly rather than annual schedule.",

This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by location (national and state) and indicator; NVSS mortality data include CVDs (e.g., heart failure).

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

                "description": "NNDSS - TABLE 1Y. Mumps to Novel influenza A virus infections - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n§ Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2012 have been variant influenza viruses.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Reporting jurisdictions were informed CDC could receive data for this condition in August 2019. Please note there will be a delay in reporting of case notifications for this condition to CDC.",

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nRent Payments (EC8)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nMedian rent payment\n\nLAST UPDATED\nAugust 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nRent payments refer to the cost of leasing an apartment or home and serves as a measure of housing costs for individuals who do not own a home. The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1970-2000\nhttps://nhgis.org \nNote: Count 1 and Count 2; Form STF1; Form SF3a\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2005-2017\nhttp://api.census.gov \nNote: Form B25058; 1-YR\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\n1970-2017\nhttp://www.bls.gov/data/\nNote: All Urban Consumers Data Table (by metro)\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). Larger geographies (metro and county) rely upon ACS 1-year data, while smaller geographies rely upon ACS 5-year rolling average data. 1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed by ABAG staff as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today’s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.",

Data are reported to MDH by local health departments, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and the Department of Juvenile Services. To appear on the list, facilities report at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 over the prior 14 days. Facilities are removed from the list when health officials determine 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending. The list provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 case activity among these facilities. Numbers reported for each facility listed reflect totals ever reported for cases.

These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Age Group, and by whether another placement episode for that child began within 12 months of their discharge from care or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F. Consent Decree Exit Plan Outcome #11: Permanency Maintained (No Re-Entry), although those figures are reported to the DCF Court Monitor on a quarterly rather than annual schedule.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Ehrlichiosis/Anaplasmosis - 2015.In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.   NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.   Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ��� Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. �� Cumulative total E. ewingii cases reported for year 2015 = 0, and 14 cases reported for 2014.",

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nRent Payments (EC8)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nMedian rent payment\n\nLAST UPDATED\nSeptember 2016\n\nDESCRIPTION\nRent payments refer to the cost of leasing an apartment or home and serves as a measure of housing costs for individuals who do not own a home. The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1970-2000\nhttps://nhgis.org \nNote: Count 1 and Count 2; Form STF1; Form SF3a\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2005-2015\nhttp://api.census.gov \nNote: Form B25058; 1-YR\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\n1970-2015\nhttp://data.bls.gov\nNote: All Urban Consumers Data Table (by metro)\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). Larger geographies (metro and county) rely upon ACS 1-year data, while smaller geographies rely upon ACS 5-year rolling average data. 1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed by ABAG staff as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today’s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.",

                "description": "NNDSS - Table II. Cryptosporidiosis to Dengue - 2015.In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed.The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ��� Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. �� Data for dengue-like illness will be included in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to receive data for this condition.",
