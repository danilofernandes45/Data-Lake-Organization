                "description": "The Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States. After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.",

                "description": "The Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States. After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

                "description": "Data Description: The National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) is a reporting standard that fire departments nationwide use to uniformly report on the full range of fire department activities. This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2016.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State’s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati’s Open Data Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets: (1) the last two digits of all addresses have been replaced with “XX,” and in cases where there is a single digit street address, the entire address number is replaced with \"X\"; and (2) Latitude and Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area (but not the exact location) of the incident.",

Included in this data set are the defendant counts by gender and initiation, their associated offense type, and year.\r\n\r\nAn initiation is how an arrest turns into a “case” in the courts. Most cases are initiated through a process known as felony review, in which SAO attorneys make a decision whether or not to prosecute. Cases may also be indicted by a grand jury or, in narcotics cases, filed directly by law enforcement (labeled \"BOND SET (Narcotics)\" in this data). Included in this data set are the defendant counts by initiation and year. This data includes felony cases handled by the Criminal, Narcotics, and Special Prosecution Bureaus. It does not include information about cases processed through the Juvenile Justice and Civil Actions Bureaus.",

The reporter’s name may be released verbally or in writing to the courts, the district or county attorney, law enforcement agencies, and DFPS staff. \n\nAPS case-related information is confidential.  APS only provides the reporter with pertinent case information necessary to:\n  •  confirm whether allegations will be accepted for investigation;\n  •  collect evidence and gather relevant information related to allegations and the alleged victim’s overall situation and risk; and\n  •  arrange for protective services to reduce risk of harm or alleviate abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation.\n\n1.

Sites participating in these flexibilities are indicated in the newly added <b><i>COVID Meal Site</b></i> column of this dataset. For more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b> This dataset only includes claims submitted by CACFP sites operating as centers providing care for students outside of school hours.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Adult Day Care Centers, Child Care Centers, At-Risk Child Care Centers, Head Start Centers, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all CACFP data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/iekx-7mdi target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Child and Adult Care Food Programs</a></b> page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b> page. <p>\n\n<b>More information about accessing and working with TDA data on the Texas Open Data Portal</b> can be found on the SquareMeals.org website on the <b><a href=http://www.squaremeals.org/FandNResources/PublicInformationRequests/TDAFoodandNutritionOpenData.aspx target=\"_blank\">TDA Food and Nutrition Open Data</a> </b>page.<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.<p>\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP), and the summer meal programs. TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</b></i><br>",

Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer, Legler and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic closures to perform facilities upgrade or emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence, Little Italy (formerly Roosevelt) and Northtown reopened in early 2019 in new locations. The library also opened its 81st location, West Loop, in January. Douglass and Jefferson Park were closed for extensive renovations for most of the year. Legler, South Shore and Merlo were also closed for extensive renovations and will remain closed until 2020. In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Chicago Public Library closed facilities to the public March 21, 2020 – June 7, 2020.",

The Issuance datasets are not updated to reflect violation status, the information only represents the violation(s) at the time they are issued. Since appearing on an issuance dataset, a violation may have been paid, dismissed via a hearing, statutorily expired, or had other changes to its status. To see the current status of outstanding parking violations, please look at the Open Parking & Camera Violations dataset.</p>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2020 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2020/pvqr-7yc4\">here</a>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2019 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2019/faiq-9dfq\">here</a>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2018 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2018/a5td-mswe\">here</a>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2017 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2017/2bnn-yakx\">here</a>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2016 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus\">here</a>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2015 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2015/c284-tqph\">here</a>\r\n• Parking Violations Issued Fiscal Year 2014 can be found <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2014/jt7v-77mi\">here</a>",

Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic closures to perform facilities upgrade or emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence, Little Italy (formerly Roosevelt) and Northtown reopened in early 2019 in new locations. The library also opened its 81st location, West Loop, in January. Douglass and Jefferson Park were closed for extensive renovations for most of the year. Legler, South Shore and Merlo were also closed for extensive renovations and will remain closed until 2020. In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Chicago Public Library closed facilities to the public March 21, 2020 – June 7, 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Count does not reflect the total building visitor count due to location of traffic counter.

EDA funds UCs to provide technical assistance and specialized services (for example, feasibility studies, marketing research, economic analysis, environmental services, and technology transfer) to local officials and communities. This assistance improves the community’s capacity to plan and manage successful development projects. UCs develop client profiles and report findings to EDA, which evaluates the performance of each center once every 3 years and verifies the data. “Taking action as a result of the assistance facilitated” means to implement an aspect of the technical assistance provided by the UC in one of several areas: economic development initiatives and training session development; linkages to crucial resources; economic development planning; project management; community investment package development; geographic information system services; strategic partnering to public or private sector entities; increased organizational capacity; feasibility plans; marketing studies; technology transfer; new company, product, or patent development; and other services.",

The system moves beyond test scores and graduation rates to provide a more holistic, multi-factor perspective of district and school performance.\n\nThe 12 Indicators are:\n1. Academic achievement status measured by state assessments\n2. Academic growth on Smarter Balanced\n3. Assessment participation rate\n4. Chronic absenteeism\n5. Preparation for postsecondary and career readiness – coursework\n6. Preparation for postsecondary and career readiness – exams\n7. Graduation – on track in ninth grade\n8. Graduation – four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate – all students\n9. Graduation – six-year adjusted cohort graduation rate – high needs\n10. Postsecondary entrance rate – all students (college enrollment)\n11. Physical fitness\n12. Arts access",

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nAll open and completed tree trim requests made to 311 since January 1, 2011. The Department of Streets and Sanitation maintains all trees growing in the public way and performs regular maintenance trimming in response to 311 requests. Crisis trimming is performed on an emergency basis in response to hazardous conditions such as broken or hanging branches. Requests that have been labeled as Duplicates are in the same geographic area and have been entered into 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system at around the same time as a previous request. Duplicate requests are labeled as such in the Status field, as either \"Open - Dup\" or \"Completed - Dup.\" Data is updated daily.",

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nAll open graffiti removal requests made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011. The Department of Streets & Sanitation's Graffiti Blasters crews offer a vandalism removal service to private property owners. Graffiti Blasters employ \"blast\" trucks that use baking soda under high water pressure to erase painted graffiti from brick, stone and other mineral surfaces. They also use paint trucks to cover graffiti on the remaining surfaces. Organizations and residents may report graffiti and request its removal.\n311 sometimes receives duplicate requests for graffiti removal. Requests that have been labeled as Duplicates are in the same geographic area and have been entered into 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system at around the same time as a previous request. Duplicate reports/requests are labeled as such in the Status field, as either \"Open - Dup\" or \"Completed - Dup.\" Data is updated daily.",

When an inspection results in more than one violation, values for associated fields are repeated for each additional violation record.  Establishments are uniquely identified by their CAMIS (record ID) number. Keep in mind that thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset. \r\nRecords are also included for each restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet received an inspection. Restaurants that received no violations are represented by a single row and coded as having no violations using the ACTION field. \r\nBecause this dataset is compiled from several large administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that could be a result of data entry or transfer errors. Data may also be missing. \r\nThis dataset and the information on the Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website come from the same data source.  The Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website is here: \r\nhttp://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/restaurant-grades.page\r\nSee the data dictionary file in the Attachments section of the OpenData website for a summary of data fields and allowable values.",

(https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/)\n\nAlthough the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.\n\nData are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.",

                "description": "This dataset contains the Average Daily Traffic counts and AM and PM peak hour Traffic counts measured on various road segments in the City of Cambridge from 1972 to 2017. The counts in this data set reflect only vehicle counts. An Average Daily Count measures the number of vehicles for an entire day, or an average of several days. Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs) log every vehicle that passes in each direction and this data is used to calculate Average Daily Traffic volumes and AM and PM Peak Hour Traffic Volumes for the street. The Peak Hour is average highest number of vehicles recorded during the morning and evening peak hour. Not all streets have the same peak hour. For example, the peak hour for one street could be 5 pm to 6 pm, whereas a peak hour for another street could be from 5:15 pm to 6:15 pm. The peak hour for a street can also change from day to day. When counts are done for several days, the Peak Hour count is the average of the highest peak hour over those days. \r\nAutomatic Traffic Recorders (ATR’s) are rubber hoses temporarily affixed to the street. When a vehicle passes, a pulse of air passes through the hose and triggers an air switch in a recording device on the roadside. The recorder device is a small steel box powered by a battery. Air switch triggers are stored on board and later downloaded to a computer. Note: Traditional and older ATRs were not able to record bicycles, however, more recent ATR’s (past 5 to 10 years) have been able to record bicycles that pass over the recorder.",

                "description": "This dataset shows the maximum number (cap) of Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses allowed in each Community District, as well as the current number of active Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses.\r\n\r\nThe City set caps (limits) on the number of Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses in each Community District established under Chapter 69 of the New York City Charter. The caps are 50 percent of the number of active Tobacco Retail Dealer licenses on February 24, 2018 and 50 percent of the number of licenses issued for Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer as of August 23, 2018. The cap for Tobacco Retail Dealers excludes pharmacies whose licenses permanently expire before January 1, 2019 when pharmacies and businesses that contain pharmacies can no longer sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in New York City.\r\n\r\nThe number of active licenses are grouped by borough and community district number. Each row of data represents one Community District's license cap and the number of active licenses at the time of the dataset's publication.\r\n\r\nBusinesses interested in applying for these licenses may use this dataset to determine if licenses are available in their Community District. Even if licenses are not available, businesses may be able to apply if they meet limited exceptions to the cap. Visit nyc.gov/dca for license requirements.",

Data prior to 2014 only report child abuse investigations.\r\n\r\nThe family assessment is not used in physical or sexual abuse cases, or other types of serious abuse cases seen.   It is used only in denial of critical care cases where the child is not in imminent danger. If at any time during a family assessment it appears the child isn’t safe, the case is reassigned to the child abuse assessment pathway.\r\n\r\nThe family assessment pathway results in pairing families with services and supports.  The traditional child abuse assessments result in a finding. Findings include: “founded” meaning abuse occurred and results in perpetrator placement on the child abuse registry; “confirmed” meaning abuse occurred, but it was minor, isolated and not likely to reoccur, does not go on the central abuse registry; and “unconfirmed” meaning abuse did not occur.",

Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.\"\n\nFor more see https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/documentation/SVI_documentation_2018.html",

                "description": "The Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) is used as an indicator of surface water supply conditions in Colorado. The SWSI compares the total volume of water in a basin or sub-basin against the volume available in the same month of historical years.   Depending on the month, the volume is a combination of components: streamflow, streamflow forecast, or reservoir storage.  The SWSI is calculated for Colorado’s river basins and sub-basins; this data set provides information on the Colorado’s sub-basin-level SWSI calculation.  More information is available at http://water.state.co.us/DWRDocs/Reports/Pages/SWSIReport.aspx.",

Information provided about the applicable sustainable building programs for qualifying buildings includes certification levels, certification types, ratings, or scores. Additionally, this data set contains information about other certifications (ENERGY STAR, Fitwel, and WELL) that may apply to covered buildings. If a covered building participates in the City’s BEUDO regulatory process, this data set provides two key emissions figures for the building. \n\nIn this dataset, we use Cambridge GIS Building IDs as unique identifiers for certified sustainable buildings. Building IDs refer to one physical structure, even if there are multiple street addresses associated with that structure.",

Cuomo launched NY-Sun, a total of 1 GW of solar photovoltaic has been installed or is under contract for installation, which represents more solar photovoltaic than was installed in the entire prior decade. In his 2013 State of the State address, Governor Cuomo announced that the initiative would extend to 2023. Nearly $1 billion in funding has been authorized over 10 years to meet a statewide target of three gigawatts of installed capacity.\n\nThe interactive map at https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/NY-Sun/Solar-Data-Maps/Statewide-Projects provides information on Statewide Solar Projects since 2000 by county.\n\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and accelerate economic growth. reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Patterns and Trends data does not include petroleum products used for non-energy purposes such as: propane used in the chemical industry, asphalt, road oil, lubricants, and petrochemical feedstocks.  Second, methods for attributing emissions to biogenic energy recourses have not reached consensus.  Most biofuels are treated as carbon neutral, despite growing awareness that these fuel categories should have emissions allocated to them.  Third, greenhouse influencing emissions are converted to a \"carbon equivalent\" through the use of the EPA's Greenhouse Warming Potential rates.  These are estimates that change over time as the science is refined."

                "description": "Also known as Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) Spending Breakdowns by Claim Type file. The data displayed here show average spending levels during hospitals’ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge. These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). CMS uses the information on this webpage to calculate a hospital’s MSPB Measure value, which is reported on Hospital Compare. Specifically, the MSPB Measure methodology risk-adjusts the values on this webpage to account for beneficiary age and severity of illness. This data set provides the pre-risk-adjusted values to help the public understand the MSPB Measure and its composition.",

                "description": "NNDSS - TABLE 1O.  Hansen's disease to Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n§ Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today’s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.",

                "description": "NNDSS - TABLE 1HH. Syphilis, Congenital to Syphilis, Primary and Secondary – 2020.  In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

An Engineered Sediment Control application must be used for any project subject to sediment control permit requirements that includes stormwater management. If the project is for construction of a new home on an existing recorded lot, you may use an application for Engineered Sediment Control Permit for Single Family Lots; however, this type of application may not be used for construction of townhomes. Relatively minor land disturbing activities may be approved using a Small Land Disturbing Activities (SLDA) application instead of an engineered permit.\nUpdate Frequency : Daily",

French Immersion students do not write this assessment.  For the reading portion of the assessment, students read different types of texts and answered questions about what they read. For the writing portion of the assessment, students completed two writing tasks. Student performance in writing was reported for the four components: Ideas, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) Level 4 (above the expectation). Students also received a scaled score in reading (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800). Nova Scotia teachers worked with theDepartment of Education and Early Childhood Development to build this assessment, score the writing tasks and set the performance expectations in Reading and Writing. The expectation is what students should know and be able to do on their own at the beginning of grade 6."

                "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to San Francisco residents over time. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals’ city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco’s Department of Public Health (DPH).",

                "description": "Certificates of Importation (sometimes entitled a certificate of non-importation) are primarily oaths by enslavers agreeing that they have not imported enslaved people from Africa and that they have not brought the enslaved person into Virginia for the purpose of selling them. Virginia was one of the first newly formed states to outlaw the importation of enslaved people for sale. In 1778, Governor Patrick Henry enacted legislation preventing importation of enslaved people into the commonwealth. Those that did bring their enslaved people were required to register them with the county court and sign a certificate of importation agreeing that they were not bringing enslaved people into the commonwealth with the intent to sell. The enslaved person is sometimes named, but not always, and occasionally information is given as to age, birthdate, and the state from which the individuals were moving. According to Section 3 of the act “every slave imported into this commonwealth contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act, shall upon such importation become free.” By this clause, those enslaved people who were brought into Virginia illegally could pursue their freedom in the local courts. See Freedom Suits in which many people took action to sue for their freedom on the basis of this clause. \n</br>\n</br>\nData on this spreadsheet is drawn directly from historical documents and may contain language that is now considered offensive.",

Released August 2020.\nThe Minnesota State Demographic Center (our office) and the Metropolitan Council jointly produce population and household estimates for all years between the U.S. Census Bureau's decennial (10-year) counts. \nThe Met Council produces the estimates for the seven counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington, as well as all cities and townships within those counties. \nOur office produces the estimates for the other 80 Minnesota counties outside of the 7-county metro, as well as all cities and townships within those counties. \nNotes: \nNew estimates are released annually in late July for the prior year. All data are dated to April 1.\nPersons per household is calculated by dividing the household population by the number of occupied households in any given geography. \nThe household population does not equal the total population because some residents live in \"group quarters\" settings (such as college dormitories, nursing facilities, shelters, treatment centers, religious orders, military barracks, or correctional facilities), and thus are not living in households. \nCities that cross county boundaries are segmented by each county's portion (labeled \"part\"), as well as appearing in total under \"Multi-County City\" in the \"COUNTY NAME\" column.",

To protect the privacy of individuals, data is compiled and presented at the city, ward and neighbourhood level only.  Neighbourhood results with a population under 49 are not posted to protect the information collected.  The designation of “No Response” includes households from which no census data could be collected or only partial data was available.  “Other Residential” includes dwelling units not covered by the other categories, such as a unit attached to a non-residential structure (e.g. an apartment in a store or church) or a movable structure (e.g. recreational vehicle, tent, etc.).",

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

                "description": "DPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nAs of 10/15/2020, this dataset is no longer being updated. Starting on 10/15/2020, these metrics will be calculated using a 14-day average rather than a 7-day average. The new dataset using 14-day averages can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/hree-nys2\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda. This is understandable as there has been variation within counties in COVID-19 activity (for example, rates that are higher in one town than in most other towns in the county).\n\nThis dataset includes a weekly count and weekly rate per 100,000 population for COVID-19 cases, a weekly count of COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests, and a weekly percent positivity rate for tests among people living in community settings. Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case. \n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities. \n\nThese data are updated weekly; the previous week period for each dataset is the previous Sunday-Saturday, known as an MMWR week (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf). The date listed is the date the dataset was last updated and corresponds to a reporting period of the previous MMWR week. For instance, the data for 8/20/2020 corresponds to a reporting period of 8/9/2020-8/15/2020.\n\nNotes:\n9/25/2020: Data for Mansfield and Middletown for the week of Sept 13-19 were unavailable at the time of reporting due to delays in lab reporting.",

We surveyed members of the Austin community using a survey developed by the audit team. Survey questions generally asked respondents' opinions on cultural center programs, staff, fees, and facilities. The survey opened January 3 and closed January 27, 2020. Austin community members were invited to take the survey through social media outreach and direct email invitations. The survey and outreach materials were written in English and translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese. A total of 1,330 community members responded to the survey. Respondents were asked only to respond for centers they had visited in the last two years and could respond for more than one center. In this summary of question responses, those who selected \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" were included in the total for \"agree\" and those who selected \"strongly disagree\" or \"disagree\" were included in the total for \"disagree.\" Percentages may not total 100 due to rounding.",

                    "Para cada una de las personas desmovilizadas, la Agencia calcula una situación frente al proceso de reintegración teniendo en cuenta el avance en los beneficios, el cumplimiento de asistencias y la situación jurídica de la persona. A continuación, se describen dichas situaciones y los estados asociados: • Población en proceso de reintegración: son las personas desmovilizadas que la ARN atiende permanentemente y que están cumpliendo con su ruta de reintegración. Actualmente, se tienen dos estados en este grupo. El primero de ellos es catalogado como Activo, el cual agrupa a las personas que no presentan inasistencias en las actividades programadas de su ruta de reintegración. El segundo estado dentro de este grupo es el de Inactivo y hace referencia a las personas que no tienen un reporte de asistencia a las actividades de su ruta en los últimos dos meses.  • Población ausente del proceso de reintegración: estas personas pueden tener tres estados. El primero de ellos es en investigación por causal sobreviniente, conformado por todas las personas que cuentan con algún registro de privación de libertad o condena ejecutoriada por delito anterior o posterior a su desmovilización o que se encuentren en el Programa de Protección y Asistencia de la Fiscalía General de la Nación, pero que aún no cuentan con un acto administrativo ejecutoriado de pérdida o suspensión de beneficios ya que su situación jurídica está siendo verificada por la Agencia. El segundo estado, es en investigación por abandono al proceso de reintegración y son las personas que ingresaron al proceso de reintegración, pero no registran asistencias a actividades de la ruta de reintegración en los últimos seis meses. Finalmente, el tercer estado es suspendido, y hace referencia a las personas que ingresaron al proceso de reintegración pero que mediante acto administrativo emitido por el Director General de la entidad se dispuso la suspensión de beneficios por encontrar que la persona reporta privación de la libertad en virtud de una medida de aseguramiento o por condena penal (mediante sentencia ejecutoriada) por delitos cometidos con anterioridad a su desmovilización. Los beneficios quedan suspendidos mientras dure la privación de la libertad. • Población fuera del proceso de reintegración: se refiere a las personas desmovilizadas que a través del proceso jurídico correspondiente salieron del proceso de reintegración y no acceden a sus beneficios. Esta población está conformada por las personas que presentan tres estados, a saber: pérdida de beneficios, fallecido y retiro voluntario. El último de éstos se refiere a las personas que han renunciado voluntariamente a participar en el proceso de reintegración. Las causales para la pérdida de beneficios son la existencia de una condena penal (mediante sentencia ejecutoriada) por delitos cometidos con posterioridad a su desmovilización o por los delitos de genocidio, secuestro, lesa humanidad, crímenes de guerra o los tipificados en el título II del Libro Segundo, Capitulo único del Código penal.  • Población que no han ingresado al proceso de reintegración: es la población desmovilizada que no se ha presentado en la Agencia para empezar su proceso de reintegración. Dentro de este grupo tenemos los siguientes estados:  o D1059 - Negación de acceso a beneficios, abarca a aquellas personas que se desmovilizaron en una cárcel del estado colombiano y que, por su situación jurídica, no se les permite recibir los beneficios del proceso de reintegración.              o D1059 - Reciben beneficios los familiares, este estado abarca a aquellas personas que se desmovilizaron en las cárceles y por su situación jurídica le es permitido a los familiares recibir algunos beneficios. o Por último, se encuentran los estados: extraditado, fallecido y desmovilizado sin registro de ingreso. • Población culminada: Son las personas que han cumplido con todos los requisitos establecidos por la ARN para terminar satisfactoriamente su proceso de reintegración y el único estado que se encuentra dentro de este grupo es Culminado. Es importante aclarar que, si una persona fallece con posterioridad al acto administrativo de culminación del proceso, su situación frente al proceso continúa siendo culminado.  ",

                "description": "<p>VBA SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAMS. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

A Veteran who meets the wartime service requirements is potential eligible if he/she is: • permanently and totally disabled for reasons not necessarily due to service, • age 65 or older, or • is presumed to be totally and permanently disabled for pension purposes because: o he/she is a patient in a nursing home for long-term care due to a disability, or o being disabled, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security (SS) for purposes of any benefits administered by the Commissioner, such as SS disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income. Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: • a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; • 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or • for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

                "description": "<p>VBA SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAMS. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",
