TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</b></i><p>\n\n<b>About the Dataset</b><br>\nThis data set contains claims information for <b> meal reimbursement for CACFP sites participating as emergency shelters for program year 2016-2017.</b> The CACFP program year begins October 1 and ends September 30. <p>\n\n<b>This dataset only includes claims submitted by CACFP sites operating as emergency shelters.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Adult Day Care Centers, Child Care Centers, At-Risk Child Care Centers, Head Start Centers, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.",

TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</b></i><p>\n\n<b>About the Dataset</b><br>\nThis data set contains claims information for <b> meal reimbursement for CACFP sites providing care for students outside of school hours for program year 2015-2016.</b> The CACFP program year begins October 1 and ends September 30. <p>\n\n<b> This dataset only includes claims submitted by CACFP sites operating as centers providing care for students outside of school hours.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Adult Day Care Centers, Child Care Centers, At-Risk Child Care Centers, Head Start Centers, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.",

It shows floor space (in square meters) per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. \n\nThe City of Melbourne creates unique codes to account for floor space allocated to residential space, vacant space, open space and common area. These unique codes are not included within ANZSIC 1 classification and therefore these floor areas are not included in this data set.\n\nThis data set has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The row and column totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.\n\nNon-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

                "description": "This data set provides an estimate of the number of people aged 15-34 years with newly identified confirmed chronic (or past/present) hepatitis C infection, by county and by year.  \r\nThe dataset is limited to persons aged 15 to 34 because hepatitis C infection is usually asymptomatic for decades after infection occurs.  Cases are usually identified because they have finally become symptomatic, or they were screened.  Until very recently, screening for hepatitis C was not routinely performed.  This makes it very challenging to identify persons with recent infection.  Limiting the age of newly identified patients to 15-34 years makes it more likely that the cases included in the dashboard were infected fairly recently.  It is not meant to imply that the opioid crisis’ effect on hepatitis C transmission is limited to younger people.  \r\nThe process by which case counts are determined is as follows:  Case reports, which include lab test results and address data, are sent to Pennsylvania’s electronic disease surveillance system (PA-NEDSS).  Confirmation status is determined by public health investigators who evaluate test results against the CDC case definition for hepatitis C in place for the year in which the patient was first reported (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis-c-chronic/).  Reportable disease data, including hepatitis C, is extracted from PA-NEDSS, combined with similar data sent by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH, which uses a separate surveillance system), and sent to CDC.  Case data sent to CDC (from PA-NEDSS and PDPH combined) are used to create a statewide reportable disease dataset.  This statewide file was used to generate the dashboard dataset.    \r\nNote that the term that CDC has used to denote persons with hepatitis C infection that is not known to be acute has switched back and forth between “Hepatitis C, past or present” and “Hepatitis C, chronic” over the past several years.  The CDC case definition for hepatitis C, chronic (or past or present) changed in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016.  Persons reported as confirmed in one year may not have been considered confirmed in another year.  For example, patients with a positive radioimmunoblot assay (RIBA) or elevated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) signal-to-cutoff level were counted as confirmed in 2012, but not counted as confirmed in 2016.  \r\nData sent to CDC’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System use a measure for aggregating cases by year called the MMWR year.  The MMWR, or the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is an official publication by CDC and the means by which CDC has historically presented aggregated case count data.  Since data in the MMWR are presented by week, the MMWR year always starts on the Sunday closest to Jan 1 and ends on the Saturday closest to Dec 31.  The most recent year for which case counts are finalized is 2016.  Annual case counts are finalized in May of the following year.  \r\nThe patient zip code, as submitted to PA-NEDSS, is used to determine the case’s county of residence at the time of initial case report.  In some instances, the patient zip code is unavailable.  In those circumstances, the zip code of the provider that ordered the lab test is used as a proxy for patient zip code.    \r\nUsers should note that the state prison system routinely screens all incoming inmates for hepatitis C.  If these inmates are determined to be confirmed cases, they are assigned to the county in which they were incarcerated when their confirmed hepatitis C was first identified.  Hepatitis C case counts in counties with state prisons should be interpreted cautiously in light of this enhanced screening activity.",

As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \n\nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday.

                "description": "The Colorado State Assessment System is designed to measure Colorado student’s mastery of the Colorado’s academic content standards. In December of 2009 Colorado adopted revised academic content standards progressing from early school readiness to postsecondary competencies reflective of both workforce readiness and 21st century skills. In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction.\r\nThe Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado’s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.",

For more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"\"_blank\"\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b>This dataset only includes claims submitted by CACFP sites operating as emergency shelters.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Adult Day Care Centers, Child Care Centers, At-Risk Child Care Centers, Head Start Centers, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all CACFP data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/iekx-7mdi target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Data Overview - Child and Adult Care Food Programs</a></b> page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b> page. <p>\n\n<b>More information about accessing and working with TDA data on the Texas Open Data Portal</b> can be found on the SquareMeals.org website on the <b><a href=http://www.squaremeals.org/FandNResources/PublicInformationRequests/TDAFoodandNutritionOpenData.aspx target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Food and Nutrition Open Data</a> </b>page.<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP), and the summer meal programs. TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"\"_blank\"\">website</a>.</b></i><br>",

Sediment(s) also includes settled particulate matter exposed by human activity (e.g., dredging) to the biologically active aquatic zone or to the water column.\"\n\nSoil: The MTCA definition of soil appears in Ch. 173-340-200: “…a mixture of organic and inorganic solids, air, water and the biota that exists on the earth’s surface above bedrock, including materials of anthropogenic sources such as slag, sludge, etc.” Soil is generally defined based on the particle size composition, and mineral and organic content.\n\nSurface Water: The MTCA definition of surface water is found at Ch. 173-340-200: “…lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and water courses within the state of Washington or under the jurisdiction of the state of Washington.”",
                    "Any hazardous substance that does not occur naturally or occurs at greater than natural background levels. (See WAC 173-340-200)\n\nFor a list of contaminants and their groups, see the contaminant cross reference spreadsheet.\n\nHalogentated Organics:\n\nHalogenated refers to a chemical compound or mixture that contains halogen atoms, i.e. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Bonding to carbon the halogens form a class of compounds called covalent halides, i.e. they are not electroylytic in nature. Some other terms for these compounds are halocarbons (halogenated hydrocarbons), chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, a class of molecules containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon).\n\nMetals:\n\nThese derive from a number of sources, including lead in petrol, industrial effluents, and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and rivers by acid rain. They are easily incorporated into biological molecules and exert their toxic effects by displacing essential metals of a lower binding power in biologically active molecules or by acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of enzymes.\n\nNon-Halogenated Organics:\n\nA class of organic compounds that contain at least one halogen (fluorine [F], chlorine [Cl], bromine [Br], or iodine [I]) bonded to carbon. They are subdivided into alkyl, vinylic, aryl, and acyl halides. In alkyl halides all four bonds to the carbon that bears the halogen are single bonds; in vinylic halides the carbon that bears the halogen is doubly bonded to another carbon; in aryl halides the halogen-bearing carbon is part of an aromatic ring; and in acyl halides (also called acid halides) the halogen-bearing carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen.\n\nOther Contaminants:\n\nMiscellaneous contaminants that do not fall under the other contaminant categories.\n\nPesticides:\n\nA substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.\n\nReactive Wastes:\n\nChemical waste that are unstable and readily undergo violent changes or react with water to form potentially explosive mixtures or generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes. Chemicals that contain cyanide or sulfide that can generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes.",

                    "The current status of the cleanup for the Site.\n\nAwaiting Cleanup: The site has been discovered. There may have been an initial investigation, Phase I or Phase II site assessment. A remedial investigation has not been started. No independent, VCP, or Ecology supervised work has occurred toward cleaning up the site.\n\nIn general, sites will NOT be put back into \"Awaiting Cleanup\" status once they have started. Sites with terminated VCP projects will not be put back into \"Awaiting Cleanup\" status.\n\nCleanup Complete-Active O&M/Monitoring: Use only for sites where all construction and physical cleanup work has been done and cleanup standards met, but some active operation, maintenance, and/or monitoring work is required on an ongoing basis to maintain cleanup standards. Examples include: groundwater pump & treat, hydraulic containment, active gas or vapor control systems. This is used for sites that are essentially stable but are not eligible for delisting. (See Policy 330B, #4.)\n\nIf the construction has been completed, and the site is eligible to be delisted, then de-list the site and use the \"No Further Action Required\" site status.\n\nA periodic review must be scheduled when in this category.\n\nCleanup Started: Site remedial investigation or cleanup work has begun. Includes completed interim actions. Includes Ecology or EPA supervised sites, VCP sites, and independent sites where an emergency action, remedial investigation, interim action, feasibility study, site characterization, or any other type of cleanup work has begun.\n\nConstruction Complete - Performance Monitoring: Cleanup construction and source control are complete. Performance monitoring is underway to “confirm that the cleanup action has attained cleanup standards, remediation levels, or other performance standards.\" This would be used for an unit that is undergoing natural attenuation, natural sediment recovery, or evaluating a treatment system to be sure it is going to work. This should not be used for units in confirmation monitoring, which is for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of an action once cleanup and performance standards are confirmed to be met. Refer to WAC 173-340-410 (b) and (c).\n\nIn most cases, a periodic review should be scheduled when this unit status is selected.\n\nNo Further Action Required: For sites that have received a No Further Action determination (NFA) at the Initial Investigation or Site Hazard Assessment, received an NFA letter (not ranked), or have been delisted (if ranked). If site is ranked, it must not be put into this status until the formal delisting is completed.\n\nDo not use this status for sites that have been transferred to other programs or other agencies. Only use this for sites that have actually received an NFA.\n\nSites in this status may still need a periodic review, passive O & M, monitoring or inspections, or periodic repairs.\n\nNOTE: The Site Status cannot be changed to NFA at the Site Details screen. It must be changed by using the \"NFA this Cleanup Site\" wizard, available under the ISIS \"Workflows\" link.\n\nTracked by EPA: For sites where EPA is the Responsible Unit and Superfund lead, cleanup occurs under CERCLA only, and the Unit Process Type is Federal supervised/conducted cleanup. The Site Manager should be listed as EPA unless there is an Ecology staff person assigned to the site to verify compliance with state ARARs.\n\nDo not use this status for sites that are under joint authority. If the site is transitioned back to Ecology for monitoring, the site status should be changed.",

                    "Status of the contaminant found in impacted media.\n\nBelow Cleanup Levels: The contaminant was tested and found to be below cleanup levels. Generally, we would not enter each and every contaminant that was tested; for example if an SVOC analysis was done we would not enter each SVOC with a status of \"below\". We would use this for contaminants that were believed likely to be present but were found to be below standards when tested.\n\nConfirmed Above Cleanup Levels: The contaminant is confirmed to be present above any cleanup level or likely cleanup level. For example - above MTCA method A, B, or C; above Sediment Quality Standards; or above a presumed site-specific cleanup level (such as human health criteria for a sediment contaminant).\n\nRemediated - Above: The contaminant was remediated, but remains on site above the cleanup standards, such as under a cap, building, or in a containment cell. If media are Remediated-Above, the site must have institutional controls.\n\nRemediated - Below: The contaminant was remediated, and no area of the site contains this contaminant above cleanup standards (for example - complete removal of contaminated soils).\n\nSuspected: The contaminant is suspected to be present based on some knowledge about the history of the site, knowledge of regional contaminants, or based on other contaminants known to be present."

Occasionally, a ticket will change from internal to public, or vice-versa. All tickets that originated as public requests are included in this dataset. However, technical constraints prevent us from displaying information for tickets that originated as internal work orders.\r\n\r\nPrior to using Commonwealth Connect, the City utilized iReport. Three open datasets derive from historical iReport data: \r\n-Pothole Repair Requests (https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Works/Pothole-Repair-Requests/h2y4-rf5c)\r\n-Graffiti Cleanup Requests (https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Works/Graffiti-Clean-Up-Requests/hk2d-8z9b)\r\n-Unshoveled/Icy Sidewalk Complaints (https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Works/Unshoveled-Icy-Sidewalk-Complaints/72bt-ct3c)\r\n-Snow/Ice Sidewalk Ordinance Violations (https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Works/Snow-Ice-Sidewalk-Ordinance-Violations/q8b2-58ab)",

Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.\n\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), in collaboration with the New York State Department of Public Service (DPS), conducted a statewide residential baseline study (study) from 2011 to 2014 of the single-family and multifamily residential housing segments, including new construction, and a broad range of energy uses and efficiency measures.  This dataset includes data collected from a total of 700 on-site inspections of single family buildings. The types of data collected during the inspections covers property characteristics, heating and cooling equipment, water heating equipment, appliances, lighting, clothes washing and drying, miscellaneous energy using equipment, and observable operating behavior.  The objective of the inspections was to enhance the residential baseline study with detailed on-site information and, to the degree possible, verify self-reported data from the phone and web surveys.",

For more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b>This dataset only includes claims submitted by CACFP sites operating as emergency shelters.</b> Sites can participate in multiple CACFP sub-programs. For reimbursement data on CACFP participants operating as Day Care Homes, Adult Day Care Centers, Child Care Centers, At-Risk Child Care Centers, Head Start Centers, or centers providing care for students outside school hours, please refer to the corresponding “Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP) – Meal Reimbursement” dataset for that sub-program available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all CACFP data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/iekx-7mdi target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Child and Adult Care Food Programs</a></b> page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b> page. <p>\n\n<b>More information about accessing and working with TDA data on the Texas Open Data Portal</b> can be found on the SquareMeals.org website on the <b><a href=http://www.squaremeals.org/FandNResources/PublicInformationRequests/TDAFoodandNutritionOpenData.aspx target=\"_blank\">TDA Food and Nutrition Open Data</a> </b>page.<p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by December 15 of the active program year. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly reimbursement claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program year. After 90 days from the close of the program year, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program year before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Programs (CACFP), and the summer meal programs. TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</b></i><br>",

The Division provides technical assistance, administers variances, delivers educational courses, oversees the enforcement practices of local governments and serves as secretariat to the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council.  The Division program was created by Chapter 707 of the Laws of 1981.  The New York Legislature enacted Article 18 of the Executive Law, directing the formulation of a Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code).  The Uniform Code is designed to cover new construction, building rehabilitation, fire safety, and housing maintenance.\n\nThis dataset provides listings of code officials who enforce the Uniform Code or Energy Code reported annually by local governments as required by 19 NYCRR 1203.",

                "description": "Pavement Condition Index is provided by the Department of Transportation for analyzing the conditions of the pavement for all 5,200 lane miles of roadways within the County. Pavement Condition Index or PCI is a numerical expression between 0-100 numerically representing the pavements condition. For example, a PCI of 30 is considered as “poor” whereas a PCI rating of 80 indicates pavement in very good condition.\n\nThe pavements’ numerical PCI score is developed through an analysis of nineteen (19) discrete pavement distresses (cracking, pot holes, environmental distress, utility cuts, etc.) and ranges from 1-100 with 1 being an absolute failure and 100 representing perfect conditions. This dataset is updated Bi-annually.",

                "description": "Case counts of people newly reported with chronic hepatitis B</p>\r\nHepatitis B surveillance data include all confirmed and probable cases. The Health Department often receives more than one report for each person with chronic hepatitis B and uses automatic de-duplication methods to identify repeat reports based on name, date of birth, and other information. Only the first report is counted in the data presented here. Laboratories are required to electronically report positive hepatitis B test results, as well as negative results for hepatitis B DNA. The Health Department does not routinely investigate hepatitis B reports because of the large volume; therefore it is difficult to determine when people with these infections were first infected, although most were probably infected a while ago. Case counts represent people newly reported with hepatitis B and are not prevalence or incidence. Many people with hepatitis B are asymptomatic; as a result, many cases are not diagnosed or reported. Therefore, surveillance data underestimate the true level of chronic hepatitis B in NYC.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Opioid use, or opioid use disorder, is a diagnosis indicating opioid dependence, abuse, or use. Some opioid drugs may be prescribed as part of medication-assisted treatment to relieve withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings often associated with opioid use disorders. Opioid use during pregnancy can lead to Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) for newborns.\nThis analysis is restricted to maternal hospital stays for Pennsylvania-state residents who were hospitalized in Pennsylvania hospitals.\nDisclaimer:\nPHC4’s database contains statewide hospital discharge data submitted to PHC4 by Pennsylvania hospitals.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n§ Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2012 have been variant influenza viruses.",

Invasive Pneumococcal to Legionellosis - 2015.In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ��� Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. �� Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease. This condition was previously named Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive disease and cases were reported to CDC using different event codes to specify whether the cases were drug resistant or in a defined age group, such as <5 years. Since 2010, case notifications for this condition were consolidated under one event code for Invasive pneumococcal disease.",

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nTransit Ridership (T11)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nDaily transit boardings\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nMay 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nTransit ridership refers to the number of passenger boardings on public transportation, which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nThe NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.",

                "description": "NNDSS - TABLE 1BB. Q fever, Total to Q fever, Chronic - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

                "description": "NNDSS - TABLE 1II. Tetanus to Trichinellosis - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA:  Not Available.  NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n§ Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease.",

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nTransit Ridership (T12)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nPer-capita annual transit boardings\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nMay 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nTransit ridership refers to the number of passenger boardings on public transportation, which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Tuberculosis data for weeks 4-31 are incorrect for New York City; the Middle Atlantic region total; U.S. Residents, excluding U.S. Territories total; and the grand total, due to data processing issues. \nNotice: Tuberculosis data for weeks 32-33 are incorrect for the U.S. Residents, excluding U.S. Territories total and the grand total, due to data processing issues. \n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\r\n\r\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\r\n\r\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\r\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\r\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\r\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\r\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\r\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.",

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\r\n\r\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\r\n\r\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\r\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\r\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\r\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\r\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\r\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\r\n \r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA:  Not Available.  NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.  \r\n\r\n† For acute Hepatitis C, only confirmed cases were verified.",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\r\n \r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA:  Not Available.  NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum.\r\n \r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized.

This data represents the number and percentage of juveniles who successfully completed supervision without a new offense resulting in a Consent Decree, Adjudication of Delinquency, ARD, Nolo Contendere, or finding of guilt in a criminal procedure. <br/> CY - Calendar Year\n\nThis dataset is contained within the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission’s 2018 Statewide Juvenile Justice Outcome Measure report: this report reflects outcomes of juvenile offenders whose cases were closed during the report period and who have received a period of supervision from a county juvenile probation department. These reported outcomes are associated with community protection, accountability, and competency development; three core goals of Pennsylvania's juvenile justice system.\n\nSince 2009, county juvenile probation departments have supervised and closed 126,006 cases. The proportion of cases closed successfully (without a new offense) during this time is 84.1%. For the year 2018, the proportion of cases closed successfully was 85.4%.",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\n U: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n*Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n† Case counts for reporting year 2017 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for tuberculosis are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.\r\n\r\n§ The national surveillance case definition was revised in 2017 to include infections confirmed by culture-independent diagnostic tests as probable cases.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA:  Not Available.  NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.  \r\n\r\n† Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of invasive pneumococcal disease.",

These indicators reflect quality of care inside hospitals and include inpatient mortality for certain procedures and medical conditions; utilization of procedures for which there are questions of overuse, underuse, and misuse; and volume of procedures for which there is some evidence that a higher volume of procedures is associated with lower mortality.\r\nAll the IQI measures were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data beginning 2009. US Census data files provided by AHRQ were used to derive denominators for county level (area level) IQI measures.\r\n\r\nThe mortality, volume and utilization measures IQIs are presented by hospital as rates or counts.

After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.",

The data analysis includes an examination and summary of exemptions by type or purpose for each municipality in the State.  The summary data include the number of exemptions in each type or purpose, as well as the full value of the exemption amounts.  The types are first broken down into categories of properties that are wholly exempt (and subsequently, not taxable for real property purposes) and those which are partially exempt.  Within those categories, further analysis of the type of ownership of these exempt properties is examined.   Specifically, these types of ownership are public and private.  Additionally, some properties may have exemption codes that are not contained in an agency maintained list of valid codes.  The data file contains a summary by count and full value of these invalidly coded properties, as well.  Finally, properties may have exemptions for various taxation purposes, also stated as taxing jurisdictions.  Those purposes are County, City/Town, and School taxation.  This dataset contains columns with the count and full value for exemptions in each of these taxing jurisdictions.",

The overall ratings were based on an annual survey that assigned parks letter grades (A through F), which corresponded to scores (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1 and F=0). In addition to Council District scores, the scores for parks surrounding Lake Merritt were reported as an average Lakeside score. The survey also included questions about greenery, amenities, recreation areas, and homeless encampments.

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from the National Survye of Chilrens Health (NSCH), stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, risk factor and state. NSCH is a telephone survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC (currently conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau) that examines the physical and emotional health of children 0-17 years of age. Approximate sample size is 95,000 over two rounds of data collection. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Detailed information on VEHSS NSCH analyses can be found on the VEHSS NSCH webpage (cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/national-surveys/national-survey-of-childrens-health.html). Additional information about NSCH can be found on the NSCH website (http://childhealthdata.org/learn/NSCH). The VEHSS NSCH dataset was last updated in November 2019.",

                "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2016 release. This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.\nNote: During the process of uploading the 2015 estimates, CDC found a data discrepancy in the published 500 Cities data for the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates caused when reformatting the SAS data file to the open data format. . The small area estimation model and code were correct. This data discrepancy only affected the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates on the Socrata open data file, the GIS-friendly data file, and the 500 Cities online application. The other obesity estimates (city-level age-adjusted and tract-level) and the Mapbooks were not affected. No other measures were affected. The correct estimates are update in this dataset on October 25, 2017.",

Invasive Pneumococcal to Legionellosis - 2014.In this Table, all conditions with a 5-year average annual national total of more than or equals 1,000 cases but less than or equals 10,000 cases will be displayed (��� 1,000 and ��_ 10,000). The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. ��� Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease. This condition was previously named Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive disease and cases were reported to CDC using different event codes to specify whether the cases were drug resistant or in a defined age group, such as < 5 years. Since 2010, case notifications for this condition were consolidated under one event code for Invasive pneumococcal disease.More information on NNDSS is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\nU: Unavailable. —: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n*Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n† Case counts for reporting year 2017 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for tuberculosis are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.\r\n\r\n§ Data for Haemophilus influenzae (age <5 for serotype b, nontypeable, non-b serotype, and unknown serotype) are available in Table I.",

For the latest data on COVID-19 cases in Cambridge, please refer to this dataset: https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Safety/Confirmed-COVID-19-Cases-in-Cambridge/inw8-ircw\n\nConfirmed COVID-19 cases in the City of Cambridge as reported by the Cambridge Public Health Department. This dataset summarizes cases by age cohort and gender.\nCambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) data regarding case counts come directly from MDPH and their surveillance system (MAVEN).  We use the language and terminology per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and recent guidance categorizes all confirmed or presumptive positive cases as positive.  CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1)     Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2)       People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3)       Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. (e.g, Someone might call their provider with a few symptoms and indicate that they were with someone from Biogen. In this case, the doctor may assume  positive for COVID-19 and ask the patient to self-isolate at home for two weeks).\n\n This is the process that the CPHD, and all local health departments, is following.",

A job created is a new position created and filled as a result of Sea Grant activities. An existing position that is filled with a Sea Grant-trained applicant should not be reported in this measure. A job sustained is an existing, filled position that is sustained as a direct result of Sea Grant activities. A job cannot be reported as both created and sustained in the same year.",

The Our City's Little Gems project is a direct extension of The Little Things that Run the City project that assessed the insect biodiversity of green spaces in the City of Melbourne. The Little Things that Run the City project did not originally feature butterflies, so the Our City’s Little Gems project was created to solely look at butterfly-flower interactions in our city. Please use the detailed legend for all species, environmental and location information. All species records are butterflies. All records have coordinates.",

The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\n\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/100 or a 1% chance of occurring in any year. \n\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no\tInundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no\tIsolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no\tPotential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.\n\nThe flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding. \n\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood \nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.) Participants may make lump-sum contributions. No individuals on active duty in the Armed Forces may initially begin contributing to this program after March 31, 1987.</p>",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.) Participants may make lump-sum contributions. No individuals on active duty in the Armed Forces may initially begin contributing to this program after March 31, 1987.</p>",

Shared Ride service is defined as multiple stop “door to door” services by authorized providers.  Although both reservation and passenger number for Shared Ride are simultaneously registered at the Port Authority’s Welcome Center when an individual makes a reservation, the Port Authority’s Ground Transportation Information System (GTIS) counts reservation numbers and passenger numbers separately as one reservation can have multiple passengers. This Shared Ride Reservation dataset reflects only the Shared Ride reservations.",

This dataset consists of Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) generated by participant and public transportation vehicles onboard units (OBU) and transmitted to road-side units (RSU) located throughout the Tampa CV Pilot Study area. The full set of raw, BSM data from Tampa CV Pilot can be found in the <a href=\"http://usdot-its-cvpilot-publicdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" >ITS Sandbox</a>. The data fields follow SAE J2735 and J2945/1 standards and adopted units of measure. \n\nThis dataset holds a flattened sample of the BSM data from Tampa CV Pilot. An extra geo column (coreData_position) was added to this dataset to allow for mapping of the geocoded BSM data within Socrata, and a column of random numbers (randomNum) was added to allow for random sampling of data points within Socrata.",

Chapter 390 of the Laws of 2008 created Section 171-r of the Tax Law that requires the Tax Department to produce a Brownfield Credit Report by January 31st of each year. Additionally, Part BB of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2015 amends Section 171-r to require the Tax Department to produce a supplemental Brownfield Credit Report by January 31, 2016 containing the credits claimed for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007.  The mandates require the Department to include the name of each taxpayer claiming the brownfield redevelopment tax credit, the remediated brownfield credit for real property taxes, or the environmental remediation credit, the amount of credit earned, and information identifying the brownfield project generating the credit. The Tax Department is also authorized to include any other information that it deems useful in analyzing the effects of the program.",

See links to additional data documentation (‘Additional Resources/See Also’ section) below. Data for the report come directly from returns field in the previous calendar year. Therefore, several caveats are in order: 1. The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were performed by the Department. 2. Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer’s position on the return as filed and does not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3. Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with the tax return. 4. The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million. Excess brownfield credits deferred will be available as follows: 50% of total deferred allowed in 2013; 75% of remaining credit allowed in 2014; all remaining credit allowed in 2015. Data in the report are amounts computed prior to deferral. 6. No brownfield real property tax credit or environmental remediation insurance credit submissions were received for calendar years 2005, 2006, and 2007."

The Supplier Contracts shown here include all fully executed, expenditure-only contracts, including City contracts for commodities, professional and general services, and construction from fiscal year 2018 forward, based upon the contracting departments' inputs. This data set includes both departmental and citywide contracts.\n\nThis data is presented on the Supplier Contracts report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in CSV format, which lists summary data by contract. We have removed sensitive contracts and information from this data in order to balance disclosure requirements and protected/confidential data. For example, we have removed contracts related to certain legal proceedings that are exempt from disclosure.  New data is added on a weekly basis.\n\n\nRevenue contracts, including concessions and rental income contracts, are not included in this data set; they are tracked in departmental subsystems and currently are not available in SF Open Book. For more information about Revenue Contracts, please contact the respective City Department that awards the contract, e.g. for Airport Concession Contracts, contact the San Francisco Airport Commission which maintains these records.\n\nCity Department spending may occur three ways: 1) from Contract to Purchase Order (i.e. a PO with an accounting Encumbrance) to Payment (i.e. an accounting Voucher), AKA On-Contract spending, 2) direct-to-Purchase Order (no contract, only a PO agreement and accounting Encumbrance) to Payment, and 3) Direct Voucher Payment (for limited one-time, non-recurring payments, e.g. a membership or a subscription).  Therefore, it is helpful to use both the Supplier Contracts and Supplier Payments reports on SFOpenBook, as well as on DataSF.",

This dataset also includes tank permits issued by CDPH on behalf of the Office of the Illinois State Fire Marshall (OSFM). On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \nAPPLICATION ID:  This is the unique id of the issued permit. Permits from the historic DOE are prefixed with “DOE.” Permits issued by CDPH are prefixed with “ENV_”\nAPPLICATION NAME: This is the name of the site that is being permitted. This is usually the company/owner name, address, or building name.  \nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \n APPLICATION TYPE:       \n\"ABOVEGROUND STORAGE TANK\" Permits to install or remove an Above Ground Storage Tank (AST) for dispensing and non-dispensing with a volume greater than 110 gallons.

The Comptroller does not make determinations regarding the accuracy or veracity of reports received under this chapter.  Rather, it is incumbent upon the reporting entity to determine whether it possesses eminent domain authority such that it is required to submit a report in accordance with §2206.154, and to identify in that report which provisions in law grant the entity that authority. \r\n\r\nThe Comptroller may determine that an entity is not in compliance with the requirements of Subchapter D if the entity has previously submitted a report of eminent domain authority as required under Government Code §2206.101 or 2206.154, but subsequently fails to file the report in later years and fails to inform the Comptroller of changes to the entity’s eminent domain authority (in accordance with §2206.154(c)) that would relieve the entity from future reporting obligations.  Should an entity that has previously submitted a report of eminent domain authority later inform the Comptroller that a change has occurred such that the entity no longer possesses eminent domain authority or is required to submit a report in accordance with §2206.154, that entity will not be placed on the noncompliant entities list (or will be removed from the list, as the case may be).",

                "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality. \r\n\r\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

There are approximately 3600 releases from federally regulated USTs on this list. Federally regulated USTs include USTs containing heating fuel for resale purposes and USTs that contain gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and waste oil. To learn more about federally regulated USTs please see the EPA's UST website (https://www.epa.gov/ust/learn-about-underground-storage-tanks-usts). \n\nThis dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases from federally regulated USTs that have occurred at specific locations. This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either using the DEEP on-line Public Portal (https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/) and/or at the DEEP Record Center File Room (https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/About/Environmental-Quality-Records-Records-Center-File-Room). \n\n‒\tThis list does not contain releases from non-federally regulated USTs (i.e. releases from residential heating fuel USTs).\n‒\tNot every type of release from a federally regulated UST System is required to be reported to the EPA. \n‒\tNot every release from a federally UST System is reported to the DEEP. We can only report the information we receive.\n‒\tWe know there may be errors in the data although we strive to minimize them. Examples of errors may include: misspelled or incomplete addresses and/or missing data.\n\nIf errors are found please contact the program unit using the following email address:  DEEP.Leakingust@ct.gov .",
