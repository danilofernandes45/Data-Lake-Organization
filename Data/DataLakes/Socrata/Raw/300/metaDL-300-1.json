                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nRent Payments (EC8)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nMedian rent payment\n\nLAST UPDATED\nAugust 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nRent payments refer to the cost of leasing an apartment or home and serves as a measure of housing costs for individuals who do not own a home. The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1970-2000\nhttps://nhgis.org \nNote: Count 1 and Count 2; Form STF1; Form SF3a\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2005-2017\nhttp://api.census.gov \nNote: Form B25058; 1-YR\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\n1970-2017\nhttp://www.bls.gov/data/\nNote: All Urban Consumers Data Table (by metro)\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). Larger geographies (metro and county) rely upon ACS 1-year data, while smaller geographies rely upon ACS 5-year rolling average data. 1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed by ABAG staff as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today’s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.",

A sample size of approximately 6,000 responses is collected quarterly for a maximum of 24,000 annual responses. \n\nThe Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) score is calculated as a weighted average of three survey questions that measure different facets of satisfaction with NWS services.  American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) researchers use proprietary software technology to estimate the weighting. The three questions include the overall satisfaction of NWS services, expectations of service, and a comparison to an ideal organization. Indexes are reported on a 0 to 100 scale. \n\nThe CSI was started in the United States in 1994 by researchers at the University of Michigan, in conjunction with the American Society for Quality in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and CFI Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Index was developed to provide information on satisfaction with the quality of products and services available to consumers. The survey data serve as inputs to an econometric model that benchmarks customer satisfaction with more than 300 companies in 43 industries and 10 economic sectors, as well as various services of federal and local government agencies.",

                "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nDSS CY 2020 Town counts - Number of people enrolled in DSS services in the calendar year 2020, by township and medical benefit plan.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nA recipient is counted in all townships where that recipient resided in that year.",

Net costs reflect total operating costs minus farebox revenue (i.e. operating costs that are not directly funded by system users). The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode, and system tables for net cost per boarding, total cost per boarding, and farebox recovery ratio.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\r\nhttp://www.bls.gov/data/\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nSimple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data. Financial data was inflation-adjusted to match 2015 dollar values using metro-specific Consumer Price Indices.",

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected† notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.  Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum.\r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting year 2016 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.   Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n† Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n§ Includes data for dengue and dengue-like illness. Office of Management and Budget approval of the NNDSS Revision #0920-0728 on January 21, 2016, authorized CDC to receive data for these conditions. CDC is in the process of soliciting data for these conditions.",

The raw data was condensed to remove any duplicate data that expressed the following: data rows with the same inmate name who had multiple of the same medications or multiple of the same medication type. Then the data sets were sorted by admission dates. Then grouped by quarters or years or both. After that, data was sorted by various descriptor columns: Age Range, Ethnicity, Gender and Drug type. \nWhat is the story the data is telling? The data shows a significantly higher admission rate for Caucasians and Males. The data also shows the age range of 30-34 consistently has the highest percent admission rate. The data also shows a high percentage of inmates receive Vivitrol/Revia as opposed to Suboxone. \nWhat to realize about this data? Although Males and Caucasians have a higher admission rate it is worth noting that this does not take into the account of how many inmates based on gender or ethnicity there are/were in the DOC at a given time. Regardless of Year the Inmate age peaks at 30-34 suggesting they are the most likely to seek treatment.",

The data contained in Indicators provides key financial and demographic information on municipalities in Connecticut.\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators contains the most current financial data available for each of Connecticut's 169 municipalities. The majority of this data was compiled from the audited financial statements that are filed annually with the State of Connecticut, Office of Policy and Management, Office of Finance. This database of information includes selected demographic and economic data relating to, or having an impact upon, a municipality’s financial condition. The most recent edition is for the Fiscal Years Ended 2015-2019 published in April 2021.\n\nOther Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) for Connecticut Municipalities, compiled by the CT Office of Policy and Management in the annual Municipal Fiscal Indicators report.\n\nPost-employment benefits are typically provided by municipalities to former employees or their beneficiaries as compensation for services rendered while these employees were still active. These benefits are generally divided into two broad categories – pension benefits (retirement income) and Other Post-employment Benefits (postemployment benefits other than pensions, referenced as OPEB). Forms of OPEB typically include healthcare benefits and benefits such as disability and life insurance provided outside of the pension plan.\n\nData on the Municipal Fiscal Indicators is included in the following datasets: \n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-2019/sb4i-6vik \n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Grand List Components, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Grand-List-Components-/ifrb-kp2b\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Pension Funding Information For Defined Benefit Pension Plans, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Pension-Funding-Inform/civu-w22d\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Type and Number of Pension Plans, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Type-and-Number-of-Pen/9f65-c4yr \n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB), 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Other-Post-Employment-/sa26-46h8 \n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Economic and Grand List Data, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Economic-and-Grand-Lis/wpbp-b657\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Benchmark Labor Data, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Benchmark-Labor-Data-2/db37-h23r\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Unemployment, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Unemployment-2019/cugp-2za3",

The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.</br>\n\n(2) New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years' debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year.</br>\n\n(3) The defeasance of $536 million of GO bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(4) The defeasance of $1.986 billion of GO bonds in 2008 reduced debt service in 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(5) The defeasance of $718 million of TFA bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(6) The defeasance of $196 million of TFA bonds in 2013 reduced debt service in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(7) The defeasance of $637 million of TFA bonds in 2015 with savings from Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR) reduced debt service in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(8) The defeasance of $65 million of Jay Street Development Corporation (JSDC) bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2009 and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>\n\n(9) TFA BARBs and TSASC are not included in OMB's or the Comptroller's definitions of New York City outstanding debt. For an explanation of these items, and their inclusion in NYC IBO's definition of New York City outstanding debt, please see New Outstanding Debt.</br>\n\n(10) In 2006, TSASC restructured its outstanding indebtedness. This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only series 2006-1 bonds outstanding. </br>",

                "description": "Approved in 2005, EDTIF is a state incentive program that allows local governments to create “economic development zones” in order to encourage job creation and capital investment. New or existing businesses creating new jobs or significant capital investment within these zones may apply for a partial rebate (30%) for up to 20 years of taxes paid to the state. The rebate may apply to “new state income” generated by the job growth or capital investment, including the payroll tax of the new employees, corporate income tax, and sales tax. Qualifying companies must create new jobs paying at least the median state wage.",

The formula is based on a study done by Rutgers University, which compiled and analyzed the performance of EDA construction investments after 9 years. This approach was reviewed and validated by third-party analysis conducted by Grant Thornton in 2008.

                "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into “Program Name” of Medicaid and “Medical Benefit Plan” of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into “Program Name” of Emergency Medical and “Medical Benefit Plan” of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThis data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a program in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple programs in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\n2021 is a partial year.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, corrections in the ImpaCT system for January and February 2019 caused the addition of around 2000 and 3000 recipients respectively, and the counts for many types of assistance (e.g. SNAP) were adjusted upward for those 2 months.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for",

                "description": "The American Community Survey (ACS) helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation.  This dataset provides estimates by county for Health Insurance Coverage and is summarized from summary table S2701: SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES.  The 5-year estimates are used to provide detail on every county in Pennsylvania and includes breakouts by Age, Gender, Race, Ethnicity, Household Income, and the Ratio of Income to Poverty.\n\nAn blank cell within the dataset indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute the statistic for that area.\n\nMargin of error (MOE). Some ACS products provide an MOE instead of confidence intervals. An MOE is the difference between an estimate and its upper or lower confidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created by adding the margin of error to the estimate (for the upper bound) and subtracting the margin of error from the estimate (for the lower bound). All published ACS margins of error are based on a 90-percent confidence level.\n\nWhile an ACS 1-year estimate includes information collected over a 12-month period, an ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. In the case of ACS 1-year estimates, the period is the calendar year (e.g., the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December 2015). \n\nIn the case of ACS multiyear estimates, the period is 5 calendar years (e.g., the 2011–2015 ACS estimates cover the period from January 2011 through December 2015). Therefore, ACS estimates based on data collected from 2011–2015 should not be labeled “2013,” even though that is the midpoint of the 5-year period. \n\nMultiyear estimates should be labeled to indicate clearly the full period of time (e.g., “The child poverty rate in 2011–2015 was X percent.”). They do not describe any specific day, month, or year within that time period.",

A permit consultant is an individual who receives or is promised compensation to provide permit consulting services on a \"major project\" or a \"minor project\", including any employee who receives compensation for time spent on permit consulting services. \n\n\"Permit consulting services\" means any contact with the Department of Building Inspection, the Entertainment Commission, the Planning Department, or the Department of Public Works to help a permit applicant obtain a permit. \"Permit consulting services\" do not include simple requests for information which do not otherwise include attempts to help obtain a permit. \n\nA \"major project\" is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 and which requires a permit issued by the Department of Building Inspection or the Planning Department. Estimated constructions costs are to be calculated in the same manner used to determine building permit fees under the Building Code. A \"minor project\" is a project located in the City and County of San Francisco which requires a permit issued by the Entertainment Commission.\n\nThe following individuals are not permit consultants and thus are not required to register or report: \n-a licensed architect or engineer of record for construction activity allowed or contemplated by the permit, or an employee of that architect or engineer; \n-a contractor who will be responsible for all construction activity associated with the requested permit, or an employee of that contractor; or \n-an employee or agent of an organization with tax exempt status under 26 United States Code Section 501(c)(3) communicating on behalf of that organization regarding the development of a project for that organization. \n\nEach permit consultant must register with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after providing permit consulting services. Quarterly disclosure reports must subsequently be filed with the Ethics Commission",

Examples include a personal friend, paramour, or roommate.\nIn the case of neglect, the perpetrator may also be the victim himself or herself.  This is called \"Self-neglect\".\nIn cases of family violence, a protective order can be obtained from a court that prohibits a member of a family or household from remaining in the household, and from contacting or coming near the victim. The purpose of the order is to prevent that person from committing further acts of family violence against the victim.\nThe statutes governing family violence protective orders are set forth in Texas Family Code Chapters 71-87. This order is only available when family violence has been committed by a family member, member of the household, or in some circumstances by a person the victim has dated.\n\nEach victim may have more than one perpetrator in an investigation.\n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on all DFPS programs.",

In 2009 the City of Austin doubled to $300,000 the amount of funding made available annually for this program. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, City of Austin employees were given the option to donate to the Plus 1 Fund through the City's annual Combined Charities Campaign which raises money for local and regional charitable groups. Additionally, utility customers have the option to donate to the Plus 1 Fund when they make their monthly utility bill payments. Plus 1 funding is distributed to customers by more than a dozen social service agencies including Travis County Family Services and Meals on Wheels.",

This included early operation of the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and Seamless Summer Option (SSO). Sites participating in these flexibilities are indicated in the newly added <b><i>COVID Meal Site</b></i> column of this dataset. For more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"\"_blank\"\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b> This dataset contains sponsor-level meal reimbursements.</b> Site-level meal counts are reported in the “Summer Meal Programs – Site-level meal counts are reported in the “Summer Meal Programs – Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – Meal Counts” dataset for the program year. <p> \n\nFor data on sites participating in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), please refer to the Summer Feeding Programs - Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – Meal Counts and Meal Reimbursement datasets available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. <p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all Summer Meal Program data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><u><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/52en-tt82 target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Data Overview - Summer Meals Programs</a></b> </u>page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><u><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b></u> page. <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by July 15 of the active program period. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program period. After 90 days from the close of the program period, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program period before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.<p>\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and summer meal programs. TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities.

They are typically billed on top of tariff rates, but note that tariff- and contract-specific fuel surcharges may differ from the reported surcharge. For instance, BNSF publishes three separate fuel surcharge series, based on different strike prices. Their $1.25 strike price was in effect on some grain tariffs prior to March 2011, when the $2.50 strike price calculation went into effect. In February 2015, BNSF removed the fuel surcharge from its grain tariffs. In January 2021, BNSF added the fuel surcharge back to its grain tariffs at the $3.25 strike price. All three series are included in this dataset.",

Use the filter to isolate these counts.\n\nChildren in DFPS custody are those for whom a court has appointed DFPS legal responsibility through temporary or permanent managing conservatorship or other court ordered legal basis. An adoptive placement occurs when the child's caseworker, the family's case manager, and the adoptive family sign paperwork officially placing the child in the home for adoption. Before the paperwork can be signed, a child must be free for adoption (meaning a court has terminated parental rights), have a permanency goal of adoption and the family must have been approved for adoption through a licensed child placing agency.",

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.

It is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation. This dataset provides estimates for Health Insurance Coverage in Pennsylvania and is summarized from summary table S2701: SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\nA blank cell within the dataset indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute the statistic for that area.\n\nMargin of error (MOE). Some ACS products provide an MOE instead of confidence intervals. An MOE is the difference between an estimate and its upper or lower confidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created by adding the margin of error to the estimate (for the upper bound) and subtracting the margin of error from the estimate (for the lower bound). All published ACS margins of error are based on a 90-percent confidence level.\n\nWhile an ACS 1-year estimate includes information collected over a 12-month period, an ACS 5-year estimate includes data collected over a 60-month period. In the case of ACS 1-year estimates, the period is the calendar year (e.g., the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December 2015).",

It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2019.\n\nThis dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries.\n\nDisclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\n\nFor information on the current city workforce, with names, positions and salaries, visit the \"Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles\" dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xzkq-xp2w.",

To protect the privacy of individuals, data is compiled and presented at the city, ward and neighbourhood level only.  Neighbourhood results with a population under 49 are not posted to protect the information collected.  The designation of “No Response” includes households from which no census data could be collected or only partial data was available.  “Other Residential” includes dwelling units not covered by the other categories, such as a unit attached to a non-residential structure (e.g. an apartment in a store or church) or a movable structure (e.g. recreational vehicle, tent, etc.).",

Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

                "description": "Colorado residents and visitors are well served by dedicated volunteer search and rescue teams, but mission costs are often in the thousands of dollars. By purchasing a CORSAR card you are contributing to the Search and Rescue Fund, which will reimburse these teams for costs incurred in your search and rescue. Funds remaining at the end of the year are used to help pay for training and equipment for these teams. Anyone with a current hunting/fishing license, or boat, snowmobile, ATV registration is already covered by the fund.\r\n\r\nThe card is not insurance and does not reimburse individuals nor does it pay for medical transport. Medical transport includes helicopter flights or ground ambulance. If aircraft are used as a search vehicle, those costs are reimbursed by the fund. If the aircraft becomes a medical transport due to a medical emergency, the medical portion of the transport is not covered.\r\n\r\nThe CORSAR cards are available for $3 for one year and $12 for five years, and can be purchased at over 300 retailers in the state.",

Taxable gallons are shown by fuel type for major types.  The dataset does not include gallons for aviation gas and aviation jet fuel.  Gallon amounts are from the Supplier/Terminal or “Rack” level, not the retail level. Further blending of fuel may occur throughout the fuel distribution chain. Taxable gallons are gross gallons minus exported gallons and distribution allowance gallons. \r\n\r\nTaxable gallons are reported on a monthly basis.  The dataset shows gallons reported in the Iowa Department of Revenue Fuel Tax Monthly Report by reporting month. Each reporting month reflects the prior tax period.  For example, information for the tax period June 1 through June 30 is reported during the reporting period July 1 to July 31.  \r\n\r\nThe dataset provides information on a monthly reporting period basis.  It is updated quarterly.",

They are used by mobile operators to extend service coverage and/or increase network capacity, and are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Small cells are typically radio equipment and antennae, and are placed on structures in high-density areas.\n\nWhile small cells can be installed in both private and public spaces, this data set only includes permits for small cell installation in the public right-of-way. These permits are regulated by the City's department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE). In this case, \"right-of-way\" means that a \"wireless support structure\" in the right of way. This could include city-owned poles/structures; third party-owned poles/structures; or any other structure that can be modified to support small cell installation, such as a bus shelter or certain types of street sights. In this case, right-of-way refers to the location of the antenna and supporting equipment.\n\nThe purpose of small cell permits in the right of way is for the provision of wireless service to the public. The City of Cincinnati has structured the small cell permitting process to supporting early and efficient roll-out of emerging wireless technologies, while simultaneously preserving local design guidelines and respecting the character of Cincinnati neighborhoods.\n\nData Creation: This data set is collected and maintained by the Department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE)\n\nData Created By: Department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE)\n\nRefresh Frequency: Daily\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad",

                    "Acompañamiento a la atención en Salud y atención Alimentaria a comunidades vulnerables: Acompañamiento a la atención en Salud: Son las acciones de servicio social que responden a necesidades concretas de la comunidad, orientadas a la detección, prevención y/o intervención de sus problemas de salud. Comprende la implementación de actividades de promoción de la salud, educación sanitaria, prevención de la enfermedad que se realizan en el nivel de atención primaria, dirigidas al individuo, la familia y la comunidad, en coordinación con otros niveles o sectores implicados. Las actividades de prevención y promoción de la salud se prestarán, tanto en centros sanitarios como en ámbito domiciliario o comunitario, dentro de los programas establecidos por cada servicio de salud, en relación con las necesidades de salud de la población de su ámbito geográfico. Para estas acciones de servicio social se requiere que la persona en proceso de reintegración esté capacitada previamente en estos temas y se cuente con la coordinación necesaria con las secretarias de salud para dar respuesta a necesidades concretas en salud de la comunidad. Acompañamiento en Atención Alimentaria a comunidades vulnerables: Son acciones de servicio social orientadas a prestar asistencia a comunidades que viven en condiciones de extrema pobreza, que además entre sus miembros se encuentran niños menores de cinco años, mujeres embarazadas o en periodo de lactancia, y adultos mayores en desamparo. Estas actividades buscan promover un entorno seguro para el ejercicio del derecho a la alimentación. Se pueden promover desde el porte en la producción de alimentos, saneamiento, gestión, acompañamiento y/o distribución. Aporte de habilidades Especiales que le participante ponga a disposición de la comunidad: Estas acciones de servicio social exigen de la persona en proceso de reintegración un conocimiento y experiencia comprobada, en un oficio. Estas acciones buscan aportar las habilidades y competencias de un arte determinado para aportar en la resolución de una necesidad particular de una comunidad vulnerable. Generalmente, estas acciones se expresan en el mejoramiento, acondicionamiento y/o construcción de espacios comunitarios donde viven estas comunidades. Recuperación ambiental y/o del Espacio Público: El artículo 5o de la Ley 9 de 1989. -Ley de Reforma Urbana- define el espacio público como “…el conjunto de inmuebles públicos y los elementos arquitectónicos y naturales de los inmuebles privados, destinados por su naturaleza, por su uso o afectación, a la satisfacción de necesidades urbanas colectivas que trascienden, por tanto, los límites de los intereses individuales de los habitantes. El espacio público lo constituye las áreas requeridas para la circulación, tanto peatonal, como vehicular, las áreas para la recreación pública, activa o pasiva, las franjas de retiro de las edificaciones sobre las vías, fuentes de agua, parques, plazas, zonas verdes y similares…” Por lo tanto y de acuerdo a lo anterior, las Acciones de Servicio Social que sigan esta línea serán aquellas actividades concertadas con la comunidad que partan de una necesidad que se satisfaga a partir de la instalación, adecuación y/o mantenimiento de los espacios públicos existentes. Generación de espacios de recreación, Arte, Cultura y Deporte: Son acciones de servicio social que están orientadas a la promoción de espacios donde se fomenten las diferentes manifestaciones artísticas, culturales y/o deportivas para responder a necesidades colectivas de bienestar e integración. En estas acciones, las personas en proceso de reintegración, aportaran sus saberes y habilidades para organizar, participar, acompañar, crear y/o desarrollar actividades de recreación, arte, cultura y/o deporte. Multiplicadores del conocimiento: Estas acciones de servicio social exigen de las personas en proceso de reintegración, saberes específicos y certificados sobre diferentes temas. Estas acciones están orientadas en poner a disposición de comunidades vulnerables, unos saberes específicos para aportar a ellas en la mejora de sus condiciones de vida.",

                    "Para cada una de las personas desmovilizadas, la Agencia calcula una situación frente al proceso de reintegración teniendo en cuenta el avance en los beneficios, el cumplimiento de asistencias y la situación jurídica de la persona. A continuación, se describen dichas situaciones y los estados asociados: • Población en proceso de reintegración: son las personas desmovilizadas que la ARN atiende permanentemente y que están cumpliendo con su ruta de reintegración. Actualmente, se tienen dos estados en este grupo. El primero de ellos es catalogado como Activo, el cual agrupa a las personas que no presentan inasistencias en las actividades programadas de su ruta de reintegración. El segundo estado dentro de este grupo es el de Inactivo y hace referencia a las personas que no tienen un reporte de asistencia a las actividades de su ruta en los últimos dos meses.  • Población ausente del proceso de reintegración: estas personas pueden tener tres estados. El primero de ellos es en investigación por causal sobreviniente, conformado por todas las personas que cuentan con algún registro de privación de libertad o condena ejecutoriada por delito anterior o posterior a su desmovilización o que se encuentren en el Programa de Protección y Asistencia de la Fiscalía General de la Nación, pero que aún no cuentan con un acto administrativo ejecutoriado de pérdida o suspensión de beneficios ya que su situación jurídica está siendo verificada por la Agencia. El segundo estado, es en investigación por abandono al proceso de reintegración y son las personas que ingresaron al proceso de reintegración, pero no registran asistencias a actividades de la ruta de reintegración en los últimos seis meses. Finalmente, el tercer estado es suspendido, y hace referencia a las personas que ingresaron al proceso de reintegración pero que mediante acto administrativo emitido por el Director General de la entidad se dispuso la suspensión de beneficios por encontrar que la persona reporta privación de la libertad en virtud de una medida de aseguramiento o por condena penal (mediante sentencia ejecutoriada) por delitos cometidos con anterioridad a su desmovilización. Los beneficios quedan suspendidos mientras dure la privación de la libertad. • Población fuera del proceso de reintegración: se refiere a las personas desmovilizadas que a través del proceso jurídico correspondiente salieron del proceso de reintegración y no acceden a sus beneficios. Esta población está conformada por las personas que presentan tres estados, a saber: pérdida de beneficios, fallecido y retiro voluntario. El último de éstos se refiere a las personas que han renunciado voluntariamente a participar en el proceso de reintegración. Las causales para la pérdida de beneficios son la existencia de una condena penal (mediante sentencia ejecutoriada) por delitos cometidos con posterioridad a su desmovilización o por los delitos de genocidio, secuestro, lesa humanidad, crímenes de guerra o los tipificados en el título II del Libro Segundo, Capitulo único del Código penal.  • Población que no han ingresado al proceso de reintegración: es la población desmovilizada que no se ha presentado en la Agencia para empezar su proceso de reintegración. Dentro de este grupo tenemos los siguientes estados:  o D1059 - Negación de acceso a beneficios, abarca a aquellas personas que se desmovilizaron en una cárcel del estado colombiano y que, por su situación jurídica, no se les permite recibir los beneficios del proceso de reintegración.              o D1059 - Reciben beneficios los familiares, este estado abarca a aquellas personas que se desmovilizaron en las cárceles y por su situación jurídica le es permitido a los familiares recibir algunos beneficios. o Por último, se encuentran los estados: extraditado, fallecido y desmovilizado sin registro de ingreso. • Población culminada: Son las personas que han cumplido con todos los requisitos establecidos por la ARN para terminar satisfactoriamente su proceso de reintegración y el único estado que se encuentra dentro de este grupo es Culminado.

This data can be used by agencies and the public to better understand the demographic makeup of client populations and to better understand and serve residents of all backgrounds and identities.\r\n\r\nThe data presented here has been collected through either electronic form or paper surveys offered at the point of application for services. These surveys are anonymous.\r\n\r\nEach record represents an anonymized demographic profile of an individual applicant for social services, disaggregated by response option, agency, and program. Response options include information regarding ancestry, race, primary and secondary languages, English proficiency, gender identity, and sexual orientation.\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasies or Limitations: \r\nNote that while the dataset contains the total number of individuals who have identified their ancestry or languages spoke, because such data is collected anonymously, there may be instances of a single individual completing multiple voluntary surveys. Additionally, the survey being both voluntary and anonymous has advantages as well as disadvantages: it increases the likelihood of full and honest answers, but since it is not connected to the individual case, it does not directly inform delivery of services to the applicant. The paper and online versions of the survey ask the same questions but free-form text is handled differently. Free-form text fields are expected to be entered in English although the form is available in several languages. Surveys are presented in 11 languages.  \r\n  Paper Surveys\r\n   1. Are optional\r\n   2. Survey taker is expected to specify agency that provides service\r\n   2. Survey taker can skip or elect not to answer questions\r\n   3. Invalid/unreadable data may be entered for survey date or date may be skipped\r\n   4. OCRing of free-form tet fields may fail.\r\n   5. Analytical value of free-form text answers is unclear\r\n  Online Survey\r\n   1. Are optional\r\n   2. Agency is defaulted based on the URL\r\n   3. Some questions must be answered\r\n   4.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The “Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information” dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/e9p6-as65).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.c"

One record is included for each client that paid compensation or incurred expenses during the filing period. If the lobbyist firm themselves incurred any expenses not reimbursed by a client, a record is included summarizing the lobbyist firm's expenses. If a lobbyist reported no compensation or expenses on the report, no records will be in this dataset. Records are included for a period of ten years, beginning in January, 2016. The date is determined as the filing period of the report, not the date received. Records are included for the full year so for example, all 2017 records will be included until the entire year 2017 falls outside the 10 year time span.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.\r\n\r\nDescriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF RELEASE: This publication and or referenced documents constitutes a list of individuals prepared by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission and may not be used for commercial purposes.

This data is presented on the Vendor Payments report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in this dataset in CSV format, which represents summary data by purchase order. We have removed sensitive information from this data – this is intended to show payments made to entities providing goods and services to the City and County and to protect individuals. For example, we have removed payments to employees (reimbursements, garnishments) and jury members, revenue refunds, payments for judgments and claims, witnesses, relocation and rehousing, and a variety of human services payments. New data is added on a weekly basis.\n\nSupplier payments represent payments to City contractors and vendors that provide goods and/or services to the City. Certain other non-supplier payee payments, which are made to parties other than traditional City contractors and vendors, are also included in this dataset, These include payments made for tax and fee refunds, rebates, settlements, etc.",

                "description": "The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.",

A continuación, se describen dichas situaciones y los estados asociados: • Población en proceso de reintegración: son las personas desmovilizadas que la ARN atiende permanentemente y que están cumpliendo con su ruta de reintegración. Actualmente, se tienen dos estados en este grupo. El primero de ellos es catalogado como Activo, el cual agrupa a las personas que no presentan inasistencias en las actividades programadas de su ruta de reintegración. El segundo estado dentro de este grupo es el de Inactivo y hace referencia a las personas que no tienen un reporte de asistencia a las actividades de su ruta en los últimos dos meses.  • Población ausente del proceso de reintegración: estas personas pueden tener tres estados. El primero de ellos es en investigación por causal sobreviniente, conformado por todas las personas que cuentan con algún registro de privación de libertad o condena ejecutoriada por delito anterior o posterior a su desmovilización o que se encuentren en el Programa de Protección y Asistencia de la Fiscalía General de la Nación, pero que aún no cuentan con un acto administrativo ejecutoriado de pérdida o suspensión de beneficios ya que su situación jurídica está siendo verificada por la Agencia. El segundo estado, es en investigación por abandono al proceso de reintegración y son las personas que ingresaron al proceso de reintegración, pero no registran asistencias a actividades de la ruta de reintegración en los últimos seis meses. Finalmente, el tercer estado es suspendido, y hace referencia a las personas que ingresaron al proceso de reintegración pero que mediante acto administrativo emitido por el Director General de la entidad se dispuso la suspensión de beneficios por encontrar que la persona reporta privación de la libertad en virtud de una medida de aseguramiento o por condena penal (mediante sentencia ejecutoriada) por delitos cometidos con anterioridad a su desmovilización. Los beneficios quedan suspendidos mientras dure la privación de la libertad. • Población fuera del proceso de reintegración: se refiere a las personas desmovilizadas que a través del proceso jurídico correspondiente salieron del proceso de reintegración y no acceden a sus beneficios. Esta población está conformada por las personas que presentan tres estados, a saber: pérdida de beneficios, fallecido y retiro voluntario. El último de éstos se refiere a las personas que han renunciado voluntariamente a participar en el proceso de reintegración. Las causales para la pérdida de beneficios son la existencia de una condena penal (mediante sentencia ejecutoriada) por delitos cometidos con posterioridad a su desmovilización o por los delitos de genocidio, secuestro, lesa humanidad, crímenes de guerra o los tipificados en el título II del Libro Segundo, Capitulo único del Código penal.  • Población que no han ingresado al proceso de reintegración: es la población desmovilizada que no se ha presentado en la Agencia para empezar su proceso de reintegración. Dentro de este grupo tenemos los siguientes estados:  o D1059 - Negación de acceso a beneficios, abarca a aquellas personas que se desmovilizaron en una cárcel del estado colombiano y que, por su situación jurídica, no se les permite recibir los beneficios del proceso de reintegración.              o D1059 - Reciben beneficios los familiares, este estado abarca a aquellas personas que se desmovilizaron en las cárceles y por su situación jurídica le es permitido a los familiares recibir algunos beneficios. o Por último, se encuentran los estados: extraditado, fallecido y desmovilizado sin registro de ingreso. • Población culminada: Son las personas que han cumplido con todos los requisitos establecidos por la ARN para terminar satisfactoriamente su proceso de reintegración y el único estado que se encuentra dentro de este grupo es Culminado. Es importante aclarar que, si una persona fallece con posterioridad al acto administrativo de culminación del proceso, su situación frente al proceso continúa siendo culminado.  ",

                "description": "This data is reported by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). USDA's Export Sales Reporting Program monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. Export sales reporting provides a constant stream of up-to-date market information for 40 U.S. agricultural commodities sold abroad. A single statistic reveals the significance of the program: in a typical year, the program monitors more than 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. The program also serves as an early alert on the possible impact foreign sales have on U.S. supplies and prices. The weekly U.S. Export Sales report is the most current available source of U.S. export sales data. The data is used to analyze the overall level of export demand, determine where markets exist, and assess the relative position of U.S. commodities in foreign markets.\n\nThe date field in export sales is weekly, based on the calendar year. However, the dataset also keeps track of marketing year export sales. Be cautious when aggregating the export sales data over the date variable to properly account for these factors.\n\nThe turn of the marketing year often falls on a different day of the week then the weekly calendar year reporting. In this case, FAS adds an additional row (two total) to the dataset for that calendar week. One row represents that week's values which fell in the previous marketing year, while the other row captures that week's values which fell in the new marketing year. The \"Marketing Year Start or End\" variable labels these rows as \"ENDING MY\" and \"STARTING MY\", respectively, and is otherwise empty.\n\nThis creates a double counting issue when aggregating some of the variables by calendar week. See our view, https://agtransport.usda.gov/d/885i-uek7, for an example of avoiding double counting to show total outstanding sales over time.",

                "description": "This dataset provides quarterly personal income estimates for State of Iowa produced by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis .  Data includes the following estimates: personal income, per capita personal income, proprietors' income, farm proprietors' income, compensation of employees and private nonfarm earnings, compensation, and wages and salaries for wholesale trade.  Personal income, proprietors' income, and farm proprietors' income available beginning 1997; per capita personal income available beginning 2010; and all other data beginning 1998.\n\nPersonal income is defined as the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, proprietors’ income, dividends, interest, and rent, and personal current transfer receipts, less contributions for government social insurance.  Personal income for Iowa is the income received by, or on behalf of all persons residing in Iowa, regardless of the duration of residence, except for foreign nationals employed by their home governments in Iowa.  Per capita personal income is personal income divided by the Census Bureau’s midquarter population estimates.\n\nProprietors' income is the current-production income (including income in kind) of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and tax-exempt cooperatives. Corporate directors' fees are included in proprietors' income. Proprietors' income includes the interest income received by financial partnerships and the net rental real estate income of those partnerships primarily engaged in the real estate business.\n\nFarm proprietors’ income as measured for personal income reflects returns from current production; it does not measure current cash flows. Sales out of inventories are included in current gross farm income, but they are excluded from net farm income because they represent income from a previous year’s production.\n\nCompensation to employees is the total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period.  It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries.  Compensation is presented on an accrual basis - that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee.\n\nPrivate nonfarm earnings is the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, and nonfarm proprietors' income, excluding farm and government.\n\nPrivate nonfarm wages and salaries is wages and salaries excluding farm and government.  Wages and salaries is the remuneration receivable by employees (including corporate officers) from employers for the provision of labor services. It includes commissions, tips, and bonuses; employee gains from exercising stock options; and pay-in-kind. Judicial fees paid to jurors and witnesses are classified as wages and salaries. Wages and salaries are measured before deductions, such as social security contributions, union dues, and voluntary employee contributions to defined contribution pension plans.\n\nMore terms and definitions are available on https://apps.bea.gov/regional/definitions/.",

                "description": "This dataset contains the list of tobacco products tax licenses as maintained by the Department of Revenue (DOR) that are currently active.  For the purposes of this dataset, active status indicates dealers authorized to handle tobacco products subject to Pennsylvania tax.\nThis list is intended to be refreshed monthly, removing the licenses that are cancelled or expire without renewal, and adding new licenses once they are approved.  The addresses provided are supposed to be the physical location where the taxable sales happen or taxable service provided.  The DOR generally does not validate the location address, so there may be misspelled items.\nTobacco products licenses must be conspicuously displayed at the location issued.\nIn order to reduce fraud, a portion of the license number was masked. If you suspect someone is selling unstamped cigarettes, or selling tobacco products without a license in Pennsylvania, use this link to Report Tax Fraud.  Tips can be left anonymously, but supporting documentation is helpful.\nMore information about the tobacco products tax: PA Code, Article III Cigarette and Beverage Taxes.\nPA Department of Revenue website: https://www.revenue.pa.gov.  \nCommon questions:\n•\tWhy are there out of state/out of country licenses?  Tobacco products tax requires licensing at all levels before shipping to PA wholesalers and retailers.  Some stampers, manufacturers or wholesalers maintain product outside PA and ship to PA retailers or wholesalers.  The license should be the location the product is stored. \n•\tWhat is “Other Tobacco Products” (OTP)? The cigarette tax law was amended in 2016 to include electronic cigarettes and related liquid (commonly referred to as vaping), roll-your-own tobacco (loose tobacco that can be used to make cigarettes), snuff, pipe tobacco, and other tobacco products used for chewing, ingesting or smoking.  More information is available from Revenue’s web site.\n•\tDoes this list contain every tobacco product retailer?  It should.  In order to sell product legally in PA, a retailer must be licensed. There could be pending licenses at the time of publication – if you have a concern, use the Report Fraud link above.\nMore Questions and Answers: \nhttps://revenue-pa.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/search/1/kw/tobacco%20license",

Trust Funds are financing arrangements set up with contributions from one or more donors (and in some cases from the World Bank Group too) to support development-related activities.  Reimbursable Funds represent revenues generated by the World Bank (WB) when costs incurred by the WB are reimbursed by clients, donors, or others for operational and administrative services provided to clients and/or for sharing administrative costs based on negotiated cost-sharing arrangements.\n\nFY09-FY14 data presented is based on the \"Program Cost Summary\" found within the Annex of each World Bank Budget paper.\n\nNote: The Budget data from FY15 onwards is available in https://finances.worldbank.org/d/9g9y-b7rs",

Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnote:-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. * Case counts for reporting year 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. ��� Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. The total sum of incident cases is then divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. �� Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the Arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx. �� Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive.

                "description": "The Affordable Housing Appeals Procedure List is published annually on or about February 1. The data for the Affordable Housing Appeals Procedure List comes from different sources including federal, state and local programs. This makes it difficult to ensure complete accuracy, so DOH asks municipalities to provide a local administrative review of and input on the street addresses of units and projects as well as information on deed-restricted units. The responses received by DOH vary widely from each municipality.\n\nIn developing the Affordable Housing Appeals Procedure List, DOH counts:\n\n-Assisted housing units or housing receiving financial assistance under any governmental program for the construction or substantial rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing that was occupied or under construction by the end date of the report period for compilation of a given year’s list; \n-Rental housing occupied by persons receiving rental assistance under C.G.S. Chapter 138a (State Rental Assistance/RAP) or Section 142f of Title 42 of the U.S. Code (Section 8); \n-Ownership housing or housing currently financed by the Connecticut Housing \nFinance Authority and/or the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and \n-Deed-restricted properties or properties with deeds containing covenants or restrictions that require such dwelling unit(s) be sold or rented at or below prices that will preserve the unit(s) as affordable housing as defined in C.G.S. Section 8-39a for persons or families whose incomes are less than or equal to 80% of the area median income.",

Due to this change this dataset cannot be directly combined with previous years' earnings data. The data represents a snapshot of salaries as of 2020-12-31 rather than actual paid amounts in 2020. Personnel spending data can be found on openbook.fcgov.com\n\nThese data are for the contracted position of each employee and therefore don't account for interim roles; the City of Fort Collins pay policy states that the employees in interim roles may be making up to 6% more than the reported salary.",

The formula is based on a study done by Rutgers University, which compiled and analyzed the performance of EDA construction investments after 9 years. This approach was reviewed and validated by third-party analysis conducted by Grant Thornton in 2008. Based on this formula and a review of EDA's historical results, EDA estimates that 40% of the 9-year projection would be realized after 3 years, 75% after 6 years, and 100% after 9 years.",
