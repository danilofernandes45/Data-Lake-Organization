This measure, obtained via web statistics, provides a locational context that allows the effort to broadly assess where its users are coming from. Given that the Digital Coast effort is national in scope, yet local in its approach to providing geospatial information to address coastal issues, such as coastal resilience, this measure provides valuable information that is used to direct outreach efforts and support content development. The number of communities using Digital Coast is based on Census-designated places within coastal states, including all Census-defined cities, towns, townships, boroughs, and incorporated municipalities.",

                "description": "Visibility and cloud ceiling forecasts are critical for aircraft safety and efficient operations. When visibility or cloud ceilings are low, pilots rely on instruments to navigate instead of visual reconnaissance. The Federal Aviation Administration establishes Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) thresholds—visibility less than three statute miles and/or cloud ceilings at, or below, 1000 feet—for safety.   \n\nNWS assesses the quality of IFR threshold forecasts in response to these requirements. Fundamental statistical metrics, specifically Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR), are used to track IFR forecast performance. Probability of Detection (POD), also known as Accuracy, is a ratio that describes the number of times IFR is correctly forecasted compared to the total number of IFR occurrences. FAR is a ratio that describes the number of IFR forecasts when IFR was not observed compared to the total number of forecast attempts. These two metrics must always be used in conjunction, as one can be improved at the expense of the other. Greater accuracy and a minimized FAR result in safer flights and fewer flight delays; conversely, poorer accuracy and an increased FAR result in a greater incidence of unnecessary flight delays.",

                "description": "This dataset shows shows the airports in San Mateo County where Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operators must not interfere with manned aircraft operations and notify the airport operator or control tower before operating a UAS. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued regulations for flying Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or, more commonly, drones. The following are the most important regulations related to UAS operations: 1. Fly no higher than 400 feet and remain below any surrounding obstacles when possible. 2. Do not intentionally fly over unprotected persons or moving vehicles, and remain at least 25 feet away from individuals and vulnerable property. 3. Check and follow all local laws and ordinances before flying over private property. 4. Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations, and you must see and avoid other aircraft and obstacles at all times. 5. Contact the airport or control tower before flying within five miles of an airport. The full set of regulations can be found on the Know Before You Fly Site: http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KBYF_Brochure.pdf",

A Veteran who meets the wartime service requirements is potential eligible if he/she is: • permanently and totally disabled for reasons not necessarily due to service, • age 65 or older, or • is presumed to be totally and permanently disabled for pension purposes because: o he/she is a patient in a nursing home for long-term care due to a disability, or o being disabled, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security (SS) for purposes of any benefits administered by the Commissioner, such as SS disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income. Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: • a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; • 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or • for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

                "description": "<p>VBA EDUCATION BENEFITS PROGRAM to help servicepersons adjust to civilian life after separation from military service, assist in the recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel in the active and reserve components in the Armed Forces by providing education benefits, and to provide educational opportunities to the dependents of certain service members and veterans. Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill – Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill – Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

Due to the short duration of the summer meal programs, dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program period. After 90 days from the close of the program period, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program period before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.<P>\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and summer meal programs. TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</b></i><p>",

Flexibilities were extended into the 2020-2021 program year and allowed School Nutrition Programs to operate summer meal service programs through the end of the school year as needed. <p>\n\n<b>The CEs and sites listed in this dataset may be operating under programs other than the School Nutrition Programs as part of the USDA's flexibilities during this period.</b> Please refer to the \n<a href=http://data.texas.gov/dataset/School-Nutrition-Programs-Meal-Reimbursement-Infor/i674-5yp3 target=\"blank\">School Nutrition Program (SNP) Meal Reimbursement</a>, \n<a href=http://data.texas.gov/dataset/Summer-Meal-Programs-Seamless-Summer-Option-SSO-Me/g3wi-mkrz target=\"blank\">Seamless Summer Option (SSO) Meal Count</a>, and  <a href=http://data.texas.gov/dataset/Summer-Meal-Programs-Summer-Food-Service-Program-S/tbnq-ytgh target=\"_blank\">Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) Meal Count</a> datasets for Program Year 2020-2021 to confirm the program used to serve meals.<P>\n\nFor more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all SNP data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/e2dm-5r4v target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - School Nutrition Programs</a></b> page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"_blank\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b> page. <p>\n\n<b>More information about accessing and working with TDA data on the Texas Open Data Portal</b> can be found on the SquareMeals.org website on the <b><a href=http://squaremeals.org/FandNResources/PublicInformationRequests.aspx target=\"_blank\">TDA Food and Nutrition Open Data</a> </b>page.<p>\n\n<hr>\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by September 1 of the active program year. Updates will occur quarterly and end 90 days after the close of the program year. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change. After 90 days from the close of the program year, this dataset will remain published but will no longer be updated.<p>\n\n\n<b>About the Agency</b><br>\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture administers 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs in Texas including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and summer meal programs. TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<b>For more information on these programs, please visit us at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">SquareMeals.org</a>.</b><br>",

TDA’s Food and Nutrition division provides technical assistance and training resources to partners operating the programs and oversees the USDA reimbursements they receive to cover part of the cost associated with serving food in their facilities. By working to ensure these partners serve nutritious meals and snacks, the division adheres to its mission — <i>Feeding the Hungry and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.</i><p>\n\n<i><b>For more information on these programs, please visit our <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</b></i><p>\n\n<b>About the Dataset</b><br>\nThis data set contains <b>contact and program participation information for each site participating in the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) for summer 2016 (SNP program year 2015-2016).</b> Summer meal programs operate mid-May through the end of August. <p>\n\nFor data on sites participating in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), please refer to the Summer Meal Programs – Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – Contact and Program Participation datasets available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. <p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\nTDA aims to post new program year data by July 15 of the active program period. Due to the short duration of the summer meal programs, dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program period. After 90 days from the close of the program period, the dataset will be updated at six months and one year from the close of program period before becoming archived. Archived datasets will remain published but will not be updated. Any data posted during the active program year is subject to change.",

                "description": "The Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) initiative oversees the transition to managed care for Medicaid recipients who receive mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) services in New York State. The metrics emphasize improving rates of timely follow-up treatment post discharge, timely filling of appropriate medication prescriptions post discharge, and reducing rates of readmission.The BHO MH Engagement in Care dataset is designed to assess the degree to which individuals discharged from mental health inpatient treatment engage in outpatient treatment post discharge where \"engagement\" is defined as receiving two or more outpatient mental health visits within thirty days of discharge and the degree to which individuals discharged from mental health inpatient treatment engage in outpatient treatment post discharge where \"engagement\" is defined as receiving four or more outpatient mental health visits within 60 days of discharge.\r\nThe year 2015 saw the conclusion of the first phase of the Behavioral Health Organization initiative\r\n(BHO). A new Behavioral Health Managed Care Transition phase II is underway. The data contained in\r\nthe BHO metrics span 2010 to 2014, using the 2010 calendar year for a baseline. Earlier in the program\r\n(2011‐2012) the metrics were calculated quarterly and on a year‐to‐date basis, later in (2013‐2014),\r\nNew York State Office of Mental Health opted for semi‐annual and year‐to‐date aggregations.",

Each dataset consists of 99 state-level health tracking indicators and sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2019-2024: New York State’s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Priority areas include Prevent Chronic Disease; Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Promote Well-Being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders; and Communicable Diseases. The data sets also include indicators about major cross-cutting health outcomes and indicators of health disparities, organized into Health Status and Reduce Health Disparities. The most recent year dataset includes the most recent state level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent state level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2024 state objectives for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities.",

The UER is intended to promote and facilitate community-based energy planning and energy use awareness and engagement. On April 19, 2018, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) issued the Order Adopting the Utility Energy Registry under regulatory CASE 17-M-0315. The order requires utilities under its regulation to develop and report community energy use data to the UER. \r\n\r\nThis dataset includes electricity and natural gas usage data reported at the city, town, and village level. Other UER datasets include energy use data reported at the county and ZIP code level.  \r\n\r\nData in the UER can be used for several important purposes such as planning Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) programs, developing community greenhouse gas emissions inventories, and relating how certain energy projects and policies may affect a particular community.  It is important to note that the data are subject to privacy screening and fields that fail the privacy screen are withheld.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and accelerate economic growth. reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

                "description": "This list provides Underground Storage Tank (UST) site, tank, contact and Enforcement information for the approximately 45,000 commercial underground storage tanks (USTs) previously and currently registered in Connecticut, of which about 8,000 are still in use. (There are 3 other related data sets:1- Facility and Tank Details, 2-Enforcement Summary, and 3-Compliance Details.)\n\nAnnually, or when a UST is installed, removed, or altered, a notification form must be completed via EZFile (see link) and submitted to CT DEEP.  Notification is required for non-residential underground storage tanks, including those for oil, petroleum and chemical liquids, as well as residential home heating oil tanks serving five or more units.  See online at: https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?q=322600\n\nThe underground storage tank regulations (see link) and the Connecticut underground storage tank enforcement program have been in effect since November 1985.  This list is based on notification information submitted by the public since 1985, and is updated weekly.  This list contains information on both active and on non-active USTs, as well as federally regulated and state regulated USTs.\n\nFactors to Consider When Using this data:\n\n-Not every required notification form is submitted to the DEEP.  We can only enter the information we receive.\n\n-We know there are errors in the data although we strive to minimize them.  Error examples may include: notification forms completed incorrectly by the owner/operator, data entry errors, duplicate site information, misspelled names and addresses and/or missing data.",

As of 6/27/2022, the data will be published in four tables instead of twelve.\n\nThe COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Tests by Day dataset contains cases and test data by date of sample submission.  The death data are by date of death.  This dataset is updated daily and contains information back to the beginning of the pandemic.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Cases-Deaths-and-Tests-by-Day/g9vi-2ahj.\n\nThe COVID-19 State Metrics dataset contains over 93 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 21, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-State-Level-Data/qmgw-5kp6 .\n\nThe COVID-19 County Metrics dataset contains 25 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 16, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-County-Level-Data/ujiq-dy22 .\n\nThe COVID-19 Town Metrics dataset contains 16 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 16, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Town-Level-Data/icxw-cada .   To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases and associated deaths that have been reported among Connecticut residents, broken down by race and ethnicity. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the COVID-19 update.\n\nThe following data show the number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths per 100,000 population by race and ethnicity. Crude rates represent the total cases or deaths per 100,000 people. Age-adjusted rates consider the age of the person at diagnosis or death when estimating the rate and use a standardized population to provide a fair comparison between population groups with different age distributions. Age-adjustment is important in Connecticut as the median age of among the non-Hispanic white population is 47 years, whereas it is 34 years among non-Hispanic blacks, and 29 years among Hispanics. Because most non-Hispanic white residents who died were over 75 years of age, the age-adjusted rates are lower than the unadjusted rates. In contrast, Hispanic residents who died tend to be younger than 75 years of age which results in higher age-adjusted rates.\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n \nRates are standardized to the 2000 US Millions Standard population (data available here: https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/). Standardization was done using 19 age groups (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, ..., 80-84, 85 years and older). More information about direct standardization for age adjustment is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt06rv.pdf  \n\nCategories are mutually exclusive. The category “multiracial” includes people who answered ‘yes’ to more than one race category. Counts may not add up to total case counts as data on race and ethnicity may be missing. Age adjusted rates calculated only for groups with more than 20 deaths. Abbreviation: NH=Non-Hispanic.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical",

Owning a home keeps families rooted in neighbourhoods, something that's needed for communities to flourish over time.\r\n\r\nThe homes are market priced, with a five-year deferral on the land portion of the mortgage, making them more accessible to first time buyers.\r\n\r\nA public engagement\r\n(https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/community-engagement-first-place.aspx)\r\nprocess precedes development, along with opportunities for community involvement in project design.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please go to:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/first-place.aspx",

Local operations are aircraft that remain in the local traffic pattern, execute simulated instrument approaches or low passes at the airport, and the operations to or from the airport and a designated practice area within a 20−mile radius of the tower. Itinerant operations are aircraft, either IFR (Instrument Flight Rules), SVFR, or VFR (Visual Flight Rules), that lands at an airport, arriving from outside the airport area, or departs an airport and leaves the airport area. This data is sourced from information published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) Operational Network Airport Code = FFZ.

An adult age 18 to 64 old must be substantially impaired to be eligible for APS services. \n\nSubstantial impairment is defined as: \"When a disability grossly and chronically diminishes an adult’s physical or mental ability to live independently or provide self-care as determined through observation, diagnosis, evaluation, or assessment.\"  (Texas Human Resources Code §48.002(a)(8); 40 Texas Administrative Code §705.1001)\n\nAssessment of a mental, physical, or developmental disability as indicated by one of the following: \n  •  A medical condition\n  •  Professional diagnosis\n  •  Reported or observed behavior that is consistent with such a diagnosis. The disability must cause a long-lasting and considerable inability to live independently or provide self-care.\n\nThe population totals do not match prior DFPS Data Books, printed or online. Past population estimates are adjusted based on the U.S. Census data as it becomes available. This is important to keep the data in line with current best practices, but will cause some past counts, such as Abuse/Neglect Victims per 1,000 Texas Children, to be recalculated. \n\nPopulation Data Source - Population Estimates and Projections Program, Texas State Data Center, Office of the State Demographer and the Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio. \n\nCurrent population estimates and projections for all years from 2011 to 2020 as of December 2020.",

This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.\n- Datasets are updated monthly. <br>\n- Datasets are created using CDC’s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a> and include protections designed to protect individual privacy. \n<br>\n- For more information about data collection and reporting, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html.</a><br>\n- For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\"> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a><br>\n\n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance database includes patient-level data reported by U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\"> Nationally Notifiable Condition List </a> and classified as \"immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\" by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data collected by jurisdictions are shared voluntarily with CDC.\nFor more information, visit: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\n\n<b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b>\n\nCOVID-19 case reports are routinely",

These sensors generally capture the indicated measurements hourly while the sensors are in operation during the summer.  During other seasons and at some other times, information from the sensors may not be available.  See https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75 for a dataset with land-based weather measurements at selected beaches.  The sensor locations are listed at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g3ip-u8rb.\n\nPlease note that sensor locations change with the Park District’s operational needs, primarily related to water quality.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic closures to perform facilities upgrade or emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence Branch closed due to a fire in 2015. Whitney Young has been closed since November 2017 for major renovations. Woodson Regional Library reopened after a major renovation in February 2018.",

See more details on the plan here:\nhttps://sf.gov/news/san-francisco-releases-tenderloin-neighborhood-safety-assessment-and-plan-covid-19\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nA team of representative City departments from the Healthy Streets Operation Center (Department of Emergency Management, Department of Public Health, Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, Human Rights Commission, San Francisco Police Department, San Francisco Fire Department, and Department of Public Works), SF Homeless Outreach Team, Felton Institute, and community groups and stakeholders was assembled to design and implement a robust Tenderloin Neighborhood Needs Assessment. This assessment was conducted on the morning of April 28, 2020 and consisted of multi-disciplinary teams walking each block of an area of the Tenderloin broken into six geographic zones. These zone locations are shown in the plan, and are mapped in this dataset.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis is a reference map that will not be updated.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThese zones can be used with other datasets to track trends by zone. Note that these zones are the priority zones for the Tenderloin Plan and do not represent the entire Tenderloin Neighborhood boundary. For a boundary of the entire Tenderloin, use the analysis neighborhood boundary: https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h",

If separated from enlisted service which began after September 7, 1980, or service as an officer which began after October 16, 1981, a veteran must also have served at least 24 months of continuous active duty or the full period for which called or ordered to active duty. Veterans of such recent service may qualify with less service time if they have a compensable service-connected disability or were discharged after at least 181 days, under the authority of 10 U.S.C 1171 or 1173. (b) Any veteran in the above classes with less service but discharged with a service-connected disability.

The active venue list can be found in OpenData by searching “Condoms” or using this hyperlink: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Condom-Availability-Program-HIV-condom-distrib/4kpn-sezh\r\nIn accordance with NYC OpenData laws (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/ ) DOHMH publishes this list of venues which are no longer actively listed on the NYC HealthMap.\r\nThere are a variety of reasons a venue would be removed from the NYC HealthMap:\r\n(1) Venue closed or changed ownership\r\n(2) Venue no longer wishes to be advertised to the public\r\n(3) Venue no longer distributes free safer sex products\r\n(4) Venue was removed from the NYC HealthMap because they did not re-confirming that free safer sex products are available – this could also happen temporarily. \r\nData duplication w/ inactive sheet. There are many years of historical data available within this sheet. Users will notice that many of those rows are duplicates. There are many reasons behind this; chiefly because data is refreshed hourly within DOHMH systems—causing a long historic trail of updated data. \r\nThis dataset does not represent all locations which received orders of free safer sex products from NYC DOHMH nor have the listed venues [locations] been endorsed by NYC DOHMH.",

The analysis and scores in the model provide a comparable assessment of individual countries' readiness and facility for PPP project design and implementation. For the purpose of this index, PPP refers specifically to projects which involve a long-term contract between a public-sector body and a private-sector entity for the design, construction (or upgrading), operation and maintenance of public infrastructure; with finance usually provided by, and significant construction, operation and maintenance risks transferred to, the private-sector, which also bears either availability or demand risk; but with the public sector remaining responsible for policy oversight and regulation; and the infrastructure generally reverting to public-sector control at the end of the contract term.",

The analysis and scores in the model provide a comparable assessment of individual countries' readiness and facility for PPP project design and implementation. For the purpose of this index, PPP refers specifically to projects which involve a long-term contract between a public-sector body and a private-sector entity for the design, construction (or upgrading), operation and maintenance of public infrastructure; with finance usually provided by, and significant construction, operation and maintenance risks transferred to, the private-sector, which also bears either availability or demand risk; but with the public sector remaining responsible for policy oversight and regulation; and the infrastructure generally reverting to public-sector control at the end of the contract term."

Each dataset consists of 99 state-level health tracking indicators and sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2019-2024: New York State’s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Priority areas include Prevent Chronic Disease; Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Promote Well-Being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders; and Communicable Diseases. The data sets also include indicators about major cross-cutting health outcomes and indicators of health disparities, organized into Health Status and Reduce Health Disparities. The most recent year dataset includes the most recent state level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent state level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2024 state objectives for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities.",

Use the filter to isolate these counts.\n\nChildren in DFPS custody are those for whom a court has appointed DFPS legal responsibility through temporary or permanent managing conservatorship or other court ordered legal basis. An adoptive placement occurs when the child's caseworker, the family's case manager, and the adoptive family sign paperwork officially placing the child in the home for adoption. Before the paperwork can be signed, a child must be free for adoption (meaning a court has terminated parental rights), have a permanency goal of adoption and the family must have been approved for adoption through a licensed child placing agency.",

The 2019 CT population data which is the most recent year available.  The tables that show the percent vaccinated by town and age group are an exception.  These tables use 2014 CT population estimates.  This the most recent year for which reliable estimates by town and age are available. \n\nA person who has received one dose of any vaccine is considered to have received at least one dose. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have received 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose. The number with At Least One Dose and the number Fully Vaccinated add up to more than the total number of doses because people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine fit into both categories.\n\nIn this data, a person with reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity is considered Hispanic regardless of reported race. The category Unknown includes unknown race and/or ethnicity. \n\nThe percent of people classified as Other race (not specified) and Multiple race in CT WiZ (for COVID-19 vaccine records and all other vaccine records) are higher than would be expected based on census data.  Other race, Multiple race and Unknown include people who should be classified as Asian, Black, Hispanic and White. Therefore, the coverage of these groups may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution. \n\nThe estimates for the category Multiple Races are considered unreliable\n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected.\n\nNote: As part of continuous data quality improvement efforts, duplicate records were removed from the COVID-19 vaccination data during the weeks of 4/19/2021 and 4/26/2021.",

The American Community Survey was developed by the Census Bureau to replace the long form of the decennial census program. The ACS is a large demographic survey collected throughout the year using mailed questionnaires, telephone interviews, and visits from Census Bureau field representatives to about 3.5 million household addresses annually. Starting in 2005, the ACS produced social, housing, and economic characteristic data for demographic groups in areas with populations of 65,000 or more. (Prior to 2005, the estimates were produced for areas with 250,000 or more population.) The ACS also accumulates sample over 3-year and 5-year intervals to produce estimates for smaller geographic areas, including census tracts and block groups.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2012 have been variant influenza viruses.",

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. Both the Urinary Tract Infection and Gastroenteritis PDIs include admissions for patients aged 3 months through 17 years.  The asthma PDI includes admissions for patients aged 2 through 17 years.  Eligible admissions for the Diabetes Short-term Complications PDI includes admissions for patients aged 6 through 17 years.",

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice:  In Table 1n of the 2021 NNDSS weekly tables for week 1 only, data for Haemophilus influenzae in children < 5years categorized as \"non-b serotype\" and \"unknown serotype\" were updated on 02/26/2021 to correct the data associated with these two serotype categories. The original version of the tables incorrectly displayed data for \"non-b serotype\" in the \"unknown serotype\" column and incorrectly displayed data for \"unknown serotype\" in the \"non-b serotype\" column. The data are corrected now.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of residence.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census\nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\nForm B08301 (2006-2018; place of residence)\nwww.api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. \"Other\" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation.\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Regional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties’ modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. “Transit” includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

                "description": "Dataset showing number of residents by sex. For the purpose of Census Bureau surveys and the decennial census, sex refers to a person’s biological sex. Distinction between the concepts of gender and sex:In general discussions, the concept of gender is often confused with the concept of sex, and the terms are used interchangeably. The meanings of these two concepts are not the same: sex is based on the biological attributes of men and women (chromosomes, anatomy, hormones), while gender is a social construction whereby a society or culture assigns certain tendencies or behaviors the labels of masculine or feminine. These assignments may differ across cultures and among people within a culture, and even across time. Gender may or may not correspond directly to sex--depending on the society or culture or period. That means, for example, that people may associate themselves with femininity (as defined by their culture) while being biologically male. At the Census Bureau, the sex question wording very specifically intends to capture a person's biological sex and not gender. Ambiguity of these two concepts interferes with accurately and consistently measuring what we intend to measure--the sex composition of the population.",

The American Community Survey was developed by the Census Bureau to replace the long form of the decennial census program. The ACS is a large demographic survey collected throughout the year using mailed questionnaires, telephone interviews, and visits from Census Bureau field representatives to about 3.5 million household addresses annually. Starting in 2005, the ACS produced social, housing, and economic characteristic data for demographic groups in areas with populations of 65,000 or more. (Prior to 2005, the estimates were produced for areas with 250,000 or more population.) The ACS also accumulates sample over 3-year and 5-year intervals to produce estimates for smaller geographic areas, including census tracts and block groups.",

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nIn 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.",

The dataset includes metropolitan area, county, city, and census tract tables by place of residence.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1980-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census\nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\nForm B08013 (2006-2018; place of residence; overall time)\nForm C08136 (2006-2018; place of residence; time by mode)\nForm B08301 (2006-2018; place of residence)\nwww.api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor the decennial Census datasets, breakdown of commute times was unavailable by mode; only overall data could be provided on a historical basis.\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for all metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Similarly, modal data is not available for every Bay Area city or census tract, even when the 5-year data is used for those localized geographies.\n\nRegional commute times were calculated by summing aggregate county travel times and dividing by the relevant population; similarly, modal commute time were calculated using aggregate times and dividing by the number of communities choosing that mode for the given geography. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas.",

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

This dataset summarizes cases by age cohort and gender.\nCambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) data regarding case counts come directly from MDPH and their surveillance system (MAVEN). We use the language and terminology per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and recent guidance categorizes all confirmed or presumptive positive cases as positive. CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1) Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2) People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3) Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. (e.g, Someone might call their provider with a few symptoms and indicate that they were with someone from Biogen. In this case, the doctor may assume positive for COVID-19 and ask the patient to self-isolate at home for two weeks).\n\nThis is the process that the CPHD, and all local health departments, is following.\n\nTotal positive cases include total deaths. Any count <5 will be suppressed for privacy reasons",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease.",

They are led by the youth whenever possible.  Participants represent a broad spectrum of the youth’s support network.  The youth choses who they want to include in their COS:  Participants can be the youth’s siblings, birth family members, foster or kinship care providers, teachers, relatives, church members, friends, mentors, and anyone else who is willing and able to support the youth into adulthood.  These participants come together to develop and review the youth's plans for transitioning to a successful adulthood, including strengths, hopes and dreams, and goals.  The plans cover needs in the areas of education, employment, mental and physical health, housing, and all Preparation for Adult Living (PAL) life skills training components.  The COS is about having discussions with the youth about what is needed and important to the youth and how participants can support the youth.",

The alleged perpetrator of the neglect may be the victim or the victim's caregiver.  There are three types of neglect allegations: Physical Neglect, Medical Neglect, and Mental Health Neglect.  \n\nOther allegation types include: Financial Exploitation, Physical Abuse, Emotional or Verbal Abuse, or Sexual Abuse.\n\nThe population totals do not match prior DFPS Data Books, printed or ontline. Past population estimates are adjusted based on the U.S. Census data as it becomes available. This is important to keep the data in line with current best practices, but will  cause some past counts, such as Abuse/Neglect Victims per 1,000 Texas Children, to be recalculated. \n\nPopulation Data Source - Population Estimates and Projections Program, Texas State Data Center, Office of the State Demographer and the Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio. \n  \nCurrent population estimates and projections for all years from 2011 to 2020 as of December 2020. \n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on all DFPS programs",

All reportable instances of force – whether used by a member of the Department, or against the member – are recorded on a TRI Report. Data provided here are a result of the information captured on TRI Reports.  Each record corresponds to a non-NYPD subject involved in a force incident.  The data can be used to explore the various categories of force incidents and when and in which precinct they occurred. For any given incident, there may be one or more members of service involved.  Since NYPD policy requires two-person patrols, most incidents will have at least two members. The data is used to populate the public facing Force Dashboard.

These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Gender, and by whether they had been Reunified within 12 months of their entry to care or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  Please note that these figures do not represent unique children, and so should not be used as the basis for creating a rate based on the child population of the state.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F. Consent Decree Exit Plan Outcome #7: Reunification Within 12 Months, although those figures are reported to the DCF Court Monitor on a quarterly rather than annual schedule.",

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional and county tables for total vehicle miles traveled.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nCalifornia Department of Transportation: California Public Road Data/Highway Performance Monitoring System\r\n2001-2015\r\nhttp://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hpms/datalibrary.php\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nVehicle miles traveled reflects the mileage accrued within the county and not necessarily the residents of that county; even though most trips are due to local residents, additional VMT can be accrued by through-trips. City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas for which the majority of its population falls within a given metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available in rural areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.",

Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

This dataset is at the county level. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. All PQIs apply only to adult populations (over the age of 18 years).  The rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information. \r\n\r\nThe observed rates and expected rates for each AHRQ PQI is presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).",

The alleged perpetrator of the neglect may be the victim or the victim's caregiver.  There are three types of neglect allegations: Physical Neglect, Medical Neglect, and Mental Health Neglect.  \n\nOther allegation types include: Financial Exploitation, Physical Abuse, Emotional or Verbal Abuse, or Sexual Abuse.\n\nThe population totals do not match prior DFPS Data Books, printed or ontline. Past population estimates are adjusted based on the U.S. Census data as it becomes available. This is important to keep the data in line with current best practices, but will  cause some past counts, such as Abuse/Neglect Victims per 1,000 Texas Children, to be recalculated. \n\nPopulation Data Source - Population Estimates and Projections Program, Texas State Data Center, Office of the State Demographer and the Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio. \n  \nCurrent population estimates and projections for all years from 2011 to 2020 as of December 2020. \n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on all DFPS programs.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nIn compliance with CA Government Code 6270.5 (passed via SB 272), the City must publish a catalog of enterprise systems that collect data about the public. There are certain exceptions to this detailed in the Government Code. The code is available here: http://bit.ly/CAinventory\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset changes infrequently and is uploaded manually as needed by DataSF staff\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Companion dataset inventory dataset</em>\nA companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Dataset-inventory/y8fp-fbf5\">dataset of inventoried and published datasets can be accessed online</a> as well.",

Per-capita data reflects the additional population included as a result of San Benito County’s participation in the San Jose MSA. Data is inflation-adjusted by using both nominal and real data developed by BEA and appropriately escalating real GRP data in 2009 dollars to today’s dollars (2017). This inflation adjustment approach is specific to each MSA and is different from the CPI inflation approach used for other datasets on the Vital Signs website.",

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a",

The AHRQ PDIs are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. Both the Urinary Tract Infection and Gastroenteritis PDIs include admissions for patients aged 3 months through 17 years.  The asthma PDI includes admissions for patients aged 2 through 17 years.  Eligible admissions for the Diabetes Short-term Complications PDI includes admissions for patients aged 6 through 17 years.\r\n\r\nThe rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information.  \r\n\r\nThe observed, expected, risk-adjusted rates, and difference in rates, for each AHRQ PDI are presented by resident zip code (including a statewide total).",

These data are an indicator of children younger that 6 years of age tested in NYC in a given year with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. The reference level is determined by measuring the NHANES blood lead distribution in US children ages 1 to 5 years, and is reviewed every 4 years.",

All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). As of December 21, 2021, data provides counts for people who have received at least one dose, people who have completed a primary vaccine series, and people who have received a booster dose of the vaccine. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the series. As of May 2022, there were one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR), run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Francisco residents vaccinated (as we do on the public dashboard at https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-vaccinations-neighborhood), we have included the 2019 5-year American Community Survey population estimate for each analysis neighborhood. (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/groups/B01001.html)\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset contains counts of San Franciscans who have received at least one dose (count_vaccinated), as well as counts of San Franciscans who have received at least one dose from the SF Department of Public Health (count_vaccinated_by_dph). This dataset also contains counts of San Franciscans who have completed their vaccine series (count_series_completed) and counts of residents who have received a booster dose (count_received_booster). This data is grouped by San Franciscans’ analysis neighborhoods of residence.",

This data is for years Calendar Years 2009-2014.\r\nProduct: SAHIE File Layout Overview\r\nSmall Area Health Insurance Estimates Program - SAHIE \r\nFilenames: SAHIE Text and SAHIE CSV files 2009 – 2014\r\nSource: Small Area Health Insurance Estimates Program, U.S. Census Bureau.\r\nInternet Release Date: May 2016\r\nDescription: Model‐based Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) for Counties and States File Layout and Definitions\r\n\r\nThe Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program was created to develop model-based estimates of health insurance coverage for counties and states. This program builds on the work of the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program. SAHIE is only source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates for all U.S. counties.\r\n\r\nFor 2008-2014, SAHIE publishes STATE and COUNTY estimates of population with and without health insurance coverage, along with measures of uncertainty, for the full cross-classification of:\r\n•5 age categories: 0-64, 18-64, 21-64, 40-64, and 50-64\r\n\r\n•3 sex categories: both sexes, male, and female\r\n\r\n•6 income categories: all incomes, as well as income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories 0-138%, 0-200%, 0-250%, 0-400%, and 138-400% of the poverty threshold\r\n\r\n•4 races/ethnicities (for states only): all races/ethnicities, White not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, and Hispanic (any race).\r\n\r\nIn addition, estimates for age category 0-18 by the income categories listed above are published.\r\n\r\nEach year’s estimates are adjusted so that, before rounding, the county estimates sum to their respective state totals and for key demographics the state estimates sum to the national ACS numbers insured and uninsured.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis program is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC), National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection ProgramLink to a non-federal Web site (NBCCEDP). The CDC have a congressional mandate to provide screening services for breast and cervical cancer to low-income, uninsured, and underserved women through the NBCCEDP. Most state NBCCEDP programs define low-income as 200 or 250 percent of the poverty threshold. Also included are IPR categories relevant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2014, the ACA will help families gain access to health care by allowing Medicaid to cover families with incomes less than or equal to 138 percent of the poverty line. Families with incomes above the level needed to qualify for Medicaid, but less than or equal to 400 percent of the poverty line can receive tax credits that will help them pay for health coverage in the new health insurance exchanges. \r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback as we continue to research and improve our estimation methods. The SAHIE program's age model methodology and estimates have undergone internal U.S. Census Bureau review as well as external review. See the SAHIE Methodological Review page for more details and a summary of the comments and our response. \r\n\r\nThe SAHIE program models health insurance coverage by combining survey data from several sources, including:\r\n•The American Community Survey (ACS)\r\n•Demographic population estimates\r\n•Aggregated federal tax returns\r\n•Participation records for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp program\r\n•County Business Patterns\r\n•Medicaid\r\n•Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) participation records\r\n•Census 2010\r\n\r\nMargin of error (MOE). Some ACS products provide\r\nan MOE instead of confidence intervals. An MOE is the\r\ndifference between an estimate and its upper or lower\r\nconfidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created\r\nby adding the margin of error to the estimate (for the\r\nupper bound) and subtracting the margin of error from\r\nthe estimate (for the lower bound). All published ACS\r\nmargins of error are based on a 90-percent confidence\r\nlevel.",

The Census Bureau does not tell individuals which boxes to mark or what heritage to write in. For the first time in Census 2000, individuals were presented with the option to self-identify with more than one race and this continued with the 2010 Census. People who identify with more than one race may choose to provide multiple races in response to the race question. For example, if a respondent identifies as \"Asian\" and \"White,\" they may respond to the question on race by checking the appropriate boxes that describe their racial identities and/or writing in these identities on the spaces provided.What is Race?The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of individuals in the United States. The Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification.The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.OMB requires five minimum categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.Reasons for collecting information on raceInformation on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights.

The data indicates if the dependent children were placed in kinship care or not.\nThe total number of children in this data set are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), which publishes 5 year estimates of the population. The most recent year of entries in this data set may be available before the corresponding ACS population estimates for that year are published. In that case, the data set uses values from the most recently published ACS estimates and notes the year from which those estimates are pulled. These values are updated once the Census Bureau releases the most recent estimates.”\n*Kinship care refers to the care of children by relatives or, in some jurisdictions, close family friends (often referred to as fictive kin). Relatives are the preferred resource for children who must be removed from their birth parents because it maintains the children's connections with their families.\n*The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) definition of parental drug abuse is “Principal caretaker’s compulsive use of drugs that is not of a temporary nature.”",
