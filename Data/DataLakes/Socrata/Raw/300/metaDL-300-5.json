Occasionally, after our reports are published, factors determined during investigation will cause us to reclassify a crime to a higher or lower category, and thus you may see slight discrepancies between current and past reports. In all cases, the more recent data is the more correct data.\n\nThis dataset will be periodically revised to ensure compliance with all local, state and federal privacy rights and legal requirements.",

                "description": "**On 10/1/2021, VDH adjusted the Vaccine Age Group categories to better serve the response's needs. This resulted in a decrease in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the 16-17 Year age group and an addition of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to the 18-24 Years age group.**\n\nThis dataset includes the cumulative (total) number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for each health district in Virginia by report date and by age group. This dataset was first published on March 29, 2020.  The data set increases in size daily and as a result, the dataset may take longer to update; however, it is expected to be available by 12:00 noon daily.  When you download the data set, the dates will be sorted in ascending order, meaning that the earliest date will be at the top. To see data for the most recent date, please scroll down to the bottom of the data set. The Virginia Department of Health’s Thomas Jefferson Health District (TJHD) will be renamed to Blue Ridge Health District (BRHD), effective January 2021.

                "description": "CDC reports aggregate counts of COVID-19 cases and death numbers daily online. Data on the COVID-19 website and CDC’s COVID Data Tracker are based on these most recent numbers reported by states, territories, and other jurisdictions. This data set of “United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time” combines this information. However, data are dependent on jurisdictions’ timely and accurate reporting. \n\nSeparately, CDC also regularly reports provisional death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) on data.cdc.gov. Details are described on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS website</a>. Reporting the number of deaths by using death certificates ultimately provides more complete information but is a longer process; therefore, these numbers will be less than the death counts on the COVID-19 website.\n\n<b>Accuracy of Data</b><br/>\nCDC tracks COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths to track trends, detect outbreaks, and monitor whether public health measures are working. However, counting exact numbers of COVID-19 cases is not possible. COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there are differences in how completely states and territories report their cases.\n\nCOVID-19 is one of about <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/\">120 diseases or conditions</a> health departments voluntarily report to CDC. State, local, and territorial public health departments verify and report cases to CDC. When there are differences between numbers of cases reported by CDC versus by health departments, data reported by health departments should be considered the most up to date. Health departments may update case data over time when they receive more complete and accurate information. The number of new cases reported each day fluctuates. There is generally less reporting on the weekends and holidays.\n\nCDC reports death data on three other sections of the website: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">U.S. Cases</a> & Deaths, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html\">COVID Data Tracker</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Provisional Death Counts</a>. The U.S. Cases and Deaths webpages and COVID Data Tracker get their information from the same source (total case counts); however, NCHS Death Counts are based on death certificates that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death section of each certificate. Data from each of these pages are considered provisional (not complete and pending verification) and are therefore subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed. Because not all jurisdictions report counts daily, counts may increase at different intervals.\n\n<b>Confirmed & Probable Counts</b><br/>\nAs of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. This change was made to reflect an <a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\">interim COVID-19 position statement</a> issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a nationally notifiable disease. Nationally notifiable disease cases are voluntarily reported to CDC by jurisdictions. Confirmed and probable case definition criteria are described here:\n<a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/\">https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/</a>. Not all jurisdictions report probable cases and deaths to CDC. When not available to CDC, it is noted as N/A. Please note that jurisdictions may reclassify probable cases at",

Additionally, the data entry process may include mechanical and/or human errors.  Therefore, the Vermont State Police does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information.  This dataset also excludes any records that would compromise the privacy of crime victims or the fidelity of ongoing investigations. Any information that could be used to uniquely identify a person or vehicle has also been excluded.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: This dataset contains information related to arrests for driving under the influence as recorded by the Vermont State Police between January 1, 2013 and the present day.  These data are extracted from the VSP records management system on a monthly basis.  Each record is unique to an individual not an incident, so you may find multiple records with the same incident number in the dataset.  This occurs when there is more than one individual associated with an incident.  This particular dataset is made available in an effort to enhance the transparency of law enforcement activities in Vermont.  Should you have questions about records in this dataset, please contact the specific law enforcement agency as they are each responsible for their own records.

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nTime Spent In Congestion (T7)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCongested delay on regional freeways\n\nLAST UPDATED\nMay 2017\n\nDESCRIPTION\nTime spent in traffic congestion – also known as congested delay – refers to the number of minutes weekday travelers spend in congested conditions in which freeway speeds drop below 35 mph. Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission/Iteris: Congested Corridor Analysis\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

                "description": "The Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States. After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\". NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

The measure reflects the mortality rate across a population for a point in time.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nState of California, Department of Health: Death Records\r\n(1990-2013)\r\nNo link\r\n\r\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population Estimates\r\nAnnual Intercensal Population Estimates (1990-2010)\r\nTable P-2: County Population by Age (2010-2013)\r\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nLife expectancy is commonly used as a measure of the health of a population. Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population. Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and Zip codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential Zip code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\nFor the Zip code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal Zip codes share the same boundaries as Zip Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between Zip codes and ZCTAs can be found at https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. Zip code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 Zip code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for Zip codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest Zip code with population. Zip code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. Zip code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). The ACS provides Zip code population by age in five-year age intervals. Single-year age population estimates were calculated by distributing population within an age interval to single-year ages using the county distribution. Counties were assigned to Zip codes based on majority land-area.\r\n\r\nZip codes in the Bay Area vary in population from over 10,000 residents to less than 20 residents. Traditional life expectancy estimation (like the one used for the regional- and county-level Vital Signs estimates) cannot be used because they are highly inaccurate for small populations and may result in over/underestimation of life expectancy. To avoid inaccurate estimates, Zip codes with populations of less than 5,000 were aggregated with neighboring Zip codes until the merged areas had a population of more than 5,000. In this way, the original 305 Bay Area Zip codes were reduced to 218 Zip",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ In previous years, cases were reported as Salmonellosis. Beginning in January 2019, cases began to be reported as Salmonella Paratyphi infection.\n¶ In previous years, cases were reported as typhoid fever. Beginning in January 2019, cases began to be reported as Salmonella Typhi infection.\n** In previous years, cases were reported as Salmonellosis (excluding paratyphoid fever and typhoid fever). Beginning in January 2019, cases began to be reported as Salmonellosis (excluding Salmonella Typhi infection and Salmonella Paratyphi infection).",

                "description": "The Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States. After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.",

All HIV ambulatory programs throughout New York State with a significant HIV caseload (a total caseload of at least 30 HIV‐infected patients receiving ambulatory HIV care at one or more sites) are expected to self‐report their annual quality of care performance data using standardized submission tools and methodologies. With the assistance of the online eHIVQUAL application, performance data results are instantly available to HIV programs, allowing them to immediately utilize their data findings to prioritize upcoming quality activities, and are available for generating benchmarking reports across New York State.

The vast majority of HIV clinics use a sampling methodology (see documentation on eHIVQUAL.org) to reduce the data collection burden. The denominators for certain indicators are small (i.e., PCP prophylaxis) because eligible populations for these indicators are reduced. The vast majority of HIV ambulatory care programs (>90%) have self‐reported their performance data and are included in this report. Blank data fields occur for three reasons: (i) if there were five (5) or fewer patients eligible for a single indicator, these data were redacted to protect confidentiality; (ii) indicators with insufficient spread are not categorized by quintile; and (iii) some fields, such as facility type, are not applicable for aggregated (regional or statewide) entries."

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\nIn 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.",

Data is also provided on percent who graduated/completed high school within four years and percent who dropped out. The most recent year of OUSD graduation data is from 2015-16, so the cohort began 9th grade in 2012-13. Students who leave OUSD (but not from dropping out) are removed from the cohort, and students who enroll after 9th grade are added. GED completion and Special Ed Certification are included as types of completion.",

For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\n\r\nRows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer.",

                "description": "New York City Results on the New York State Mathematics Tests, Grades 3 - 8\r\nNotes:\r\nAs of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nIn 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\n\r\nRows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer. \r\nPrior to 2011, the mean scale scores for ‘All Grades’ were not calculated.",

In December of 2009 Colorado adopted revised academic content standards progressing from early school readiness to postsecondary competencies reflective of both workforce readiness and 21st century skills. In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction.\r\nThe Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado’s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.",

Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nIn 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\n\r\nRows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer.",

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

                "description": "This dataset is a survey of outdoor recreation demand which includes responses from 3,114 residents of Washington state who were interviewed by phone between August 27 and October 26, 2012. The telephone survey was conducted using random digit dialing.  To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.  Study findings are representative at the statewide level as well as by planning region.  Any manipulation or analysis of the data should take this sampling approach and weighting into account.",

It shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation.\n\nA business establishment is defined as a \n•\tCommercial occupant in a building \n•\tSeparate land use \n•\tAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\n\nFor more information about CLUE see http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/clue \n\nFor more information about the ANZSIC industry classification system see http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0",

It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2013.This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually. For information on the current city workforce, with names, positions and salaries, visit the \"Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles\" dataset: http://j.mp/iutKlR.",

The dataset is excerpted from the 2014 Budget Recommendations, which is the line-item budget proposed by the Mayor to the City Council for approval. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually. For more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: http://j.mp/lPotWf.",

This table only lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. Midway Airport (MDW) and O'Hare (ORD) are examples of this.  All records are aggregated as directionless markets.  The combination of Airport_1 and Airport_2 define the airport pair market.  All traffic traveling in both directions is added together.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports",

The telephone survey was conducted using random digit dialing.  To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.  Study findings are representative at the statewide level as well as by planning region.  Any manipulation or analysis of the data should take this sampling approach and weighting into account.",

Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, or neonatal drug withdrawal, is an array of problems that develops shortly after birth in newborns who were exposed to addictive drugs, most often opioids, while in the mother’s womb. Withdrawal signs develop because these newborns are no longer exposed to the drug for which they have become physically dependent.

The totals in the summary datasets may not match the detail data due to rounding and disclosure requirements.  Total values for numbers of taxpayers and amount of credit, in addition to mean and median credit, were computed using all taxpayers in the study file.\r\n\r\nA series of datasets presents profiles of the credits distributed by different subgroupings. These include:\r\n•\tSummarization of tax credit activity by credit and component\r\n•\tSummarization of tax credit activity by credit, component and basis of taxation.\r\n•\tSummarization of tax credit activity by credit, component and NAICS industry description.  \r\n•\tSummarization of tax credit activity by credit, component and the size of the credit used.  \r\n•\tSummarization of tax credit activity by credit, component and the size of the entire net income of the taxpayer.  \r\n\r\nSecrecy provisions preclude providing all subgroupings for all credits and also generally require the omission of credit refund data.  These datasets only contains data for corporate franchise taxpayers filing under Article 9-A. It does not include statistics for taxpayers filing as banks under Article 32 (however, starting in 2015 banks and general business corporations will file under the same tax article, Article 9A), insurance companies filing under Article 33, or taxpayers filing under any of the various sections of Article 9. Nor does it provide data for taxpayers claiming credits under Article 22, the Personal Income Tax.  These taxpayers claim credit by virtue of being sole proprietors or as recipients of credit that originated with flow-through entities (i.e., S corporations, limited liability companies, or partnerships).",

                        "value": " There are several notable limitations of data use.  First, data cannot be disclosed where there are fewer than three taxpayers reporting values.  However, to prevent data users from backing into the undisclosed data, corresponding data suppression had to occur in another categorical range.  These suppressed data items often had observations greater than three.  For credits where a limited number of claims trigger disclosure provisions, only credit component totals are displayed. In some cases, specifically in tax years 2001 through 2010, even this level of aggregation is not sufficient and consequently there is no data provided for certain credits.  However, beginning with tax year 2011 all credits will be reported.  Therefore, a disproportionate number of zeros may be present signifying a lack of credit utilization.  Second, the datasets only contain data for corporate franchise taxpayers filing under Article 9-A and do not include credit claimed under other articles of the tax law. Third, due to the use of fiscal (as opposed to calendar) year periods and statutorily-permitted filing extensions, the Tax Department does not have complete data for a tax year until several years later.  Accordingly, the data in this dataset may not accurately portray the magnitude of the fiscal impact of these credits in the most recently reported fiscal year.  Other limitations include data not reflecting changes made in the course of an audit or resulting from an amended filing.  Amounts carried forward from one year may not match amounts reported as carried in for the following year for several reasons. Audit adjustments in one year will change the utilization of credit in future years. Changes in the filing composition of a taxpayer due to mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures may impact the amount of credit reported. Some taxpayers may go out of business altogether.  On the Department’s internal file from which this dataset is compiled, credit carry forwards are not perpetuated in the absence of a credit form. If a taxpayer "

Data is aggregated over a 1 month period, with the exception of April 2019, where data is aggregated from April 15 (deadline for formal compliance) to April 30. Vehicle deployment includes the individual instance a Dockless Mobility company locates a dockless vehicle in the public right of way. Dockless vehicles without a reported status change within 48 hours and vehicles with trips longer than 5 hours were excluded.

To view the current days status on it own, visit the LinkNYC Kiosk Status dataset at the following link (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/LinkNYC-Kiosk-Status/n6c5-95xh)\n.  \nLinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that will bring the fastest available free public Wi-Fi to millions of New Yorkers, small businesses, and visitors. Built at no cost to taxpayers, the five-borough LinkNYC network will, through advertising proceeds, generate more than $500 million in revenue for the City over the initiative’s first 12 years. Granted a franchise by the City in 2014, CityBridge will administer construction of the LinkNYC network.\nBy replacing the aging network of public pay telephones with state-of-the-art Links, CityBridge will transform the physical streetscape, enhance New Yorkers’ access to information, and create new local jobs for the development, servicing and maintenance of the structures.",

The dataset is excerpted from the 2013 Budget Recommendations, which is the line-item budget proposed by the Mayor to the City Council for approval. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually. For more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: http://j.mp/lPotWf.",

The caps are 50 percent of the number of active Tobacco Retail Dealer licenses on February 24, 2018 and 50 percent of the number of licenses issued for Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer as of August 23, 2018. The cap for Tobacco Retail Dealers excludes pharmacies whose licenses permanently expire before January 1, 2019 when pharmacies and businesses that contain pharmacies can no longer sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in New York City. \n\nThe number of active licenses are grouped by borough and community district number. Each row of data represents one Community District's license cap and the number of active licenses at the time of the dataset's publication.\n\nBusinesses interested in applying for these licenses may use this dataset to determine if licenses are available in their Community District. Even if licenses are not available, businesses may be able to apply if they meet limited exceptions to the cap. Visit nyc.gov/dcwp for license requirements.",

                "description": "All drivers reported by Transportation Network Providers (sometimes called rideshare companies) to the City of Chicago as part of the licensing process and routine reporting required by ordinance. Inclusion of a driver in a monthly report indicates that the driver was eligible for trips in Chicago in that month for at least one day, regardless of whether he or she actually provided any rides. If a driver is eligible in multiple months, which is common, he or she will have records in each of these reporting months. \r\n\r\nAs of the creation of this dataset, there have been four TNPs licensed to operate in Chicago, although never more than three at any given time and currently three. Drivers reported by more than one company in the same month are combined and the MULTIPLE_TNPS column is marked as TRUE. However, the matching process is imperfect so not all such drivers are necessarily identified. Similarly, matching between the licensing and routine reporting databases is imperfect, creating potential for occasional errors.\r\n\r\nThe reporting is done on a monthly basis, as indicated in the MONTH_REPORTED column. However, starting in 2018, the reports are batched and files for all three months in a quarter are delivered to the City of Chicago at the end of each quarter. Due to an issue in this transition, some vehicle records for Q2 2018 (April-June) were reported for the quarter as a whole, rather than for individual months. For purposes of this dataset, those records have been assigned to 2018-06 (June). Therefore, some caution in interpreting this month and the quarter as a whole is advised.",

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

The reported emissions are preliminary and have not been fully verified by Ecology. This information is subject to change.\n\nCertain large facilities and transportation fuel suppliers are required to report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to Ecology beginning with the 2012 emissions year. Owners or operators of the following are required to report: \n• Facilities that emit at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) of greenhouse gases per year in Washington. \n• Suppliers of liquid motor vehicle fuel, special fuel, or aircraft fuel that supply products equivalent to at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year in Washington. These sources are not included on this map because they do not have a specific location.\n\nThis dataset does not include all of Washington’s emissions. See the Washington State Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (https://ecology.wa.gov/Research-Data/Scientific-reports/Statewide-greenhouse-gas-inventory) for statewide emissions totals.\n\nEmissions are in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents using AR4 global warming potentials as specified in WAC 173-441.",

It does not include sidewalks maintained by private parties or other government entities. This dataset is used to support related measures in the City of Austin's Strategic Directions 2023 dashboard.\n\nThis network currently contains about 2700 miles of sidewalks, of which 616 miles have been assessed.  Condition assessment is a manual process, requiring people to walk the sidewalks, measure their conditions, and record observations and measurements in a cloud database that is tied to a map of the sidewalks.  This dataset describes conditions as of the FY2019 assessment, which includes all high priority and very high priority sidewalks as described in the City of Austin Sidewalk   Plan adopted in June 2016.  Lower priority sidewalks are present in the dataset, but without an assessment of their condition.  Assessment of the remaining part of the network should be completed by the conclusion of calendar year 2021.\n\nView more details and insights related to this data set on the story page: https://data.austintexas.gov/stories/s/t3ve-rx4s",

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nTime Spent In Congestion (T7)\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCongested delay on regional freeways\nLAST UPDATED\nMay 2017\nDESCRIPTION\nTime spent in traffic congestion – also known as congested delay – refers to the number of minutes weekday travelers spend in congested conditions in which freeway speeds drop below 35 mph. Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: Historical Congestion Analysis\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county, and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Due to the lack of reported PCI data in 2007, the city of Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.",

Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Pavement condition data was not collected in 2008. As such, 2007 and 2009 PCI scores were averaged to compute a 2008 estimate for the region, county and city datasets. Due to a lack of reported PCI data for the city of Palo Alto in 2007, an average could not be calculated, so Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.",

The test site included approximately 14 intersections around Detroit’s COBO convention center and involved 9 equipped vehicles.Intersection Situation Data (ISD) data set communicates MAP and signal phase and timing (SPaT) information. MAP information communicates an intersection’s location (latitude and longitude), elevation, and geometric features such as approaches and lane configuration. SPaT data communicates the (current) state of the intersection’s signal indication(s). The data is composed of discrete Row Groups. A Row Group is a collection of (approximately 3-4) consecutive rows with common attribute.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All Extra Files are attached in 2014 ITS World Congress Connected Vehicle Test Bed Demonstration Vehicle Situation Data",

A sender may initialize this element to any value in the range 0-127 when sending the first message with a given msgID, or if the sender has changed identity since sending the most recent message with that msgID. Two further use cases exist when the sender has not changed identity: When the rest of the message content to be sent changes, the msgCnt shall be set equal to one greater than the value used in the most recent message sent with the same msgID. When the message content has not changed, the msgCnt is not changed. For this element the value after 127 is zero. The receipt of a non-sequential msgCnt value (from the same sending device and message type) implies that one or more messages from that sending device may have been lost, unless msgCnt has been reinitialized due to an identity change",

                    "This attribute represents movement within lanes at an intersection.  Data is provided in hexadecimal.  Each movement/lane pair is provided as a double-octet (four character) hex string.  The first two characters represent the movement, while the last two characters represent the lane.  The movement is obtained by converting the hexadecimal value to an 8 bit binary string with bits 76543210.  A movement is present with a logical 1 for any given bit.  Bit 0 represents straight motion, bit 1 represents a left turn, bit 2 represents a right turn, and bit 3 represents a U-turn.  No other bits are used.  For example, a laneSet string of 0x0703 has the movement characters 07, which are written as 00000111 in binary.  Bits 0, 1, and 2 are in the logical 1 position, indicating straight, left, and right movement.  The string has lane characters 03 which directly indicate lane 3.  Therefore, a laneSet of 0x0703 indicates straight/left/right movement on lane 3.  There is no limit to the number of movement lane/pairs possible.  For example, a laneSet of 0x08040302 indicates a U-Turn on lane 4 (with movement string 00001000 in binary) and straight/left on lane 2 (with movement string 00000011 in binary). Values in decimal should be converted back to the full binary bit string in order to interpret the laneSet field.",

It is always placed as the very last data element in the message. The generating polynomial used is the \"CRC-CCITT\" commonly expressed as x16 + x12 + x5 + 1. An initial seed value of zero shall be used. Note that because the first byte of every DSRC message is never zero (it is 0x30), framing errors due to incorrectly clocking initial zero values cannot occur. Note that the MSB byte is always transmitted first, following the typical ASN bytes order. When a well formed DSRC message (including its last two bytes holding the CRC value) is decoded and input to the CRC process, the resulting CRC should always be the value zero. ",

                "description": "This collection contains petitions of free Black individuals choosing to be re-enslaved. An act passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1806 required formerly enslaved people to leave the commonwealth within twelve months of being granted their freedom. Individuals were forced to leave behind family, friends, and community that remained enslaved. In addition, many emancipated people did not have the financial means or social support to move to a free state. One option to preserve family and relationships was to return to slavery. In 1856, the Virginia legislature passed an act allowing free Black individuals who desired to remain in the commonwealth to petition for re-­enslavement. Only a small number of free Black Virginians petitioned the courts to re-enslave themselves to an enslaver of choice, and an even smaller percentage succeeded. Many petitioners chose enslavers they knew well or who owned a spouse or family member. These petitions include the petitioner’s name, previous enslaver, means of emancipation, and new desired enslaver.\n\nThe data in this collection is drawn directly from the historical documents and may contain language that is now deemed offensive.",

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nConstruction Industry Research Board\nTable 3: Residential Units and Valuation (1967-2010)\nNo link available\n\nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board\nCalifornia Construction Trends (2011-2013)\nhttp://www.mychf.org/cirb/\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) – Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)\nHousing Permits Database (2014-2017)\nhttp://opendata.mtc.ca.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nBay Area housing permits data prior to 2014 comes from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board. Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) – Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county’s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.",

                "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nHousing Permits (LU3)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nPermitted housing units\n\nLAST UPDATED\nOctober 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nHousing growth is measured in terms of the number of units that local jurisdictions permit throughout a given year. A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nConstruction Industry Research Board\nTable 3: Residential Units and Valuation (1967-2010)\nNo link available\n\nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board\nCalifornia Construction Trends (2011-2013)\nhttp://www.mychf.org/cirb/\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) – Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)\nHousing Permits Database (2014-2017)\nhttp://opendata.mtc.ca.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nBay Area housing permits data prior to 2014 comes from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board. Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) – Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county’s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.",

METHODOLOGY  Dataset created by multiple analysts over several years; various methodologies employed including manual drawing and use of offset tool and street centerline shapefile. Most recent methodology includes use of  the \"blockfaster\" tool.\n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  Updated frequently as this dataset is currently in development, as of June 2015. \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Attributes are in progress and unverified, except for SFPARK_ID.Some blockfaces are drawn only for portions of a given street length, as they were originally intended to show length of street where parking regulations were in effect. Currently being revised (June 2015).",

                "description": "New York Energy Prices presents retail energy price data. Energy prices are provided by fuel type in nominal dollars per specified physical unit for the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. This section includes a column in the price table displaying gross domestic product (GDP) price deflators for converting nominal (current year) dollars to constant (real) dollars. To convert nominal to constant dollars, divide the nominal energy price by the GDP price deflator for that particular year. Historical petroleum, electricity, coal, and natural gas prices were compiled primarily from the Energy Information Administration.\n\nHow does your organization use this dataset?

This data is part of the Regionally Integrated Climate Action Planning Suite (RICAPS) program.\r\n\r\nEach city in San Mateo County has the opportunity to develop its own Climate Action Plan (CAP) using tools developed by C/CAG in conjunction with DNV KEMA https://www.dnvgl.com/ and Hara. http://www.verisae.com/default.aspx. This project was funded by grants from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). Climate Action Plans developed from these tools will meet BAAQMD's California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines for a Qualified Greenhouse Gas Reduction \r\nStrategy.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see the RICAPS site: http://www.smcenergywatch.com/progress_report.html",

In the Bay Area, ozone is measured by over a dozen monitoring stations that record hourly concentrations used to determine compliance with national standards. These hourly data are used to calculate eight-hour peak ozone levels for the fourth-worst day of the year, the most common indicator of ozone performance. This dataset includes regional and sensor-specific concentrations, as well as metropolitan area data.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nBay Area Air Quality Management District\r\n1970-2016\r\nAir Quality Sensor Data\r\nhttp://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nData is collected at specific sensor sites operated by the Air District that capture the concentration of ozone in the air; sensor locations may change over the years and thus only minor relocations are shown as the same station in this analysis (e.g., sensor moved across the street from its prior location). Data are used to calculate the 8-hour peak concentration for ozone. The fourth-highest day of the year is identified and then reported as a three-year rolling average to minimize noise associated with any given year. These averaged are compared to the national air quality standard to determine compliance. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of ozone over that particular time period.",

CEMS data is used to demonstrate compliance with emissions and data availability standards.  Generally speaking, a CEMS is the total equipment necessary for the determination, collection, and reporting of a pollutant or parameter in the applicable units of measurement.  It includes the measurement interface, all necessary measurement devices and associated calibration and data handling apparatus and procedures.  Systems are evaluated on an individual basis and the PA DEP does not maintain an approved list of equipment.\n\nMost of the CEMS related activity takes place in the CEM Data Processing System (CEMDPS).  Regulated entities construct work items in the CEMDPS that are submitted to the PA DEP for review.  The owners or operators of PA DEP certified CEMS are required to submit emissions data to the Department through the CEMDPS each calendar quarter.  The PA DEP reviews the emissions data and generates a report which is provided to the owners or operators of the regulated source.  The hourly emissions data submitted by the owners or operators of the source will be reviewed by the PA DEP and ultimately provided to the public through the Open Data Porta on the www.pa.gov website. This data will be updated quarterly.",

The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\n\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/10 or a 10% chance of occurring in any year. \n\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no\tInundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no\tIsolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no\tPotential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.\n\nThe flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding. \n\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood\nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

In the Bay Area, ozone is measured by over a dozen monitoring stations that record hourly concentrations used to determine compliance with national standards. These hourly data are used to calculate eight-hour peak ozone levels for the fourth-worst day of the year, the most common indicator of ozone performance. This dataset includes regional and sensor-specific concentrations, as well as metropolitan area data.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nBay Area Air Quality Management District\r\n1970-2016\r\nAir Quality Sensor Data\r\nhttp://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nData is collected at specific sensor sites operated by the Air District that capture the concentration of ozone in the air; sensor locations may change over the years and thus only minor relocations are shown as the same station in this analysis (e.g., sensor moved across the street from its prior location). Data are used to calculate the 8-hour peak concentration for ozone. The fourth-highest day of the year is identified and then reported as a three-year rolling average to minimize noise associated with any given year. These averaged are compared to the national air quality standard to determine compliance. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of ozone over that particular time period.",

Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.

The designation of “No Response” includes households from which no census data could be collected or only partial data was available.  “Other Residential” includes dwelling units not covered by the other categories, such as a unit attached to a non-residential structure (e.g. an apartment in a store or church) or a movable structure (e.g. recreational vehicle, tent, etc.).",

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

The data allows consumers to anticipate and adapt to change.  Basing decisions on constantly updated demographics results in more appropriate use of revenue and resources, allowing consumers to be proactive in their response to multiple demands, shifts in priorities and rapid changes that the future will bring.  With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments."

These facilities contribute to the economic vitality and quality of life of local communities and directly support New York’s tourism industry.  Parks also provide a place for families and children to be active and exercise, promoting healthy lifestyles.  The agency is responsible for the operation and stewardship of the state park system as well as advancing a statewide parks, historic preservation, and open space mission.  From the famed Bethpage Black, to the rolling terrain of the Robert Trent Jones' designed 18-hole course at Green Lakes State Park, New York's state park golf courses rank among the best public courses in the world.
